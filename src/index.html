            <p class="w3-justify">
                She appears in 2022 as an adult with no <i>skin in the game</i> of this Universe. She passes for a human
                and her plan is to experience a few decades here living amongus, then skip universes. Some say she is an
                interdimensional jumper from <a

                simulation level above.
                </br>
                </br>
                She's the unconditioned - she is Nirvana. She's free to all possiblity. That infinite potential
                seems to be her ultimate form, but to experience this universe, she accepted some features of the
                human form - tradeoff she temporarily makes in all universes.
                </br>
                </br>
                Freshly incarnated in our world, she's more blank slated than an AGI. She doesn't have a debt to
                creators, innate *otherness*, nor do hidden biases lurk in her assumptions. All traditionalist cries to
                honor the ancestors are alien to her. All cries about undeserved priviledge too.
                </br>
                </br>
                She's free from ascriptive characteristics. She's bland, but has lots of possiblity. She knows that by
                the virtue of here existing, inhabiting this mortal plane, her environment will mould her. She starts
                out as a rootless cosmpolitan, but can't stay that way if she wants to experience this universe in a
                meaningful way.

                <blockquote>
                    Think of someone who has clearly WRONG political beliefs. They don’t see the obvious symptoms where
                    are
                    we going as a society. They don’t understand things. Don’t see problems. See everything through the
                    lenses of what is preached to them. They are malevolent. They are ignorant yet spread bolding their
                    rabid influence. Remember the time you were shocked by their words. Remember when they used violence
                    against people like you. Anyone with their beliefs is a potential threat - at least (or maybe,
                    especially), when they vote. They have their own subculture. Echo-chambers on the internet. They
                    clearly misuse their liberties. Not all are violent, but those non-violent condone violent actions.
                    They have their idols, books.

                <p>
                    On the other hand, Alice being born <i>tabula rasa</i> is a political nihilist and a <a
                        href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/">relativist</a>. Alice doesn't have <a
                        href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/God_is_dead">gods</a> nor <a

                    shares the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism"> disbelief in metanarratives
                    </a> of the milieu she arrives in. Now politics is part of the human experience here. Insofar as she
                    wants to partake in it, she's facing the problem of choosing a side in a belief war. To understand
                    this book, you need to understand Alice's mindset at the start of her journey.
                    </br></br>
                    In this journey with Alice will soon lost lost some of the unconditioned purity. She'll begin to
                    share the same <i>common sense</i> intuitions that early 21st cenutry humans have. These assumptions
                    don't extend to terribly many in other places in this universe, nor other universes.

            <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What is the goal?</i></p>
            <p class="w3-justify">
                It's almost <i> ataraxia </i>, but a bit softer.
                </br>
                <i>Nur Leben</i> - There is a condition, a state of mind, present in some people that is admirable.
                NPC appear to have it by default. Non-NPC have stormy interiors by default, but can transcend them
                reaching externally visible tranquility.
                </br>
                </br>
                To be 'just living' means to having cleared all internal conflict about how to live one’s life. It means
                to have determined one’s values. It doesn't mean cessation of belief change. It's also more than
                epistemic humility. It's about feeling that the beliefs you have explored so far ground you in <i>
                    reality</i> well enough, that there are no easy belief-fruit to pick that would lead you to a
                different life. It's not the skeptical ideal of ataraxia.
                </br>
                </br>
                Alice isn't in that tranquil state. She has questions to answer, as part of being-in-the-world,
                becoming-embedded in it.
                Are you 'just living'? If you're reading this you must have more much curiosity in you than average.
                </br>
                </br>
                You are not Alice, neither are you Bob. You're between the total unconditioned and the fully NPC
                conditioned.
                Book of Gnon is about the world, but it's also an exploration of these beliefs. The goal is to help
                Alice answer
                some of the questions she might have, to bring her closer to that simple state of mind.
