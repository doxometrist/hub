1. There is no escape from your belief being a web of cyclic graph of beliefs [?]
	1. If it is not my will that creates all, then there is something beside me. That is Nature.
		1. XS, abstract horror note 1 > Outside’ only in the abstract sense (encompassing the negative immensity of everything that we cannot grasp 
	2. We are bound to have some set of beliefs, best if circular, at the core of our big set of beliefs.
		1. Dealing with 5 ancient arguments
			1. [It's the steelman of scepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippa_the_Skeptic#The_five_modes_of_Agrippa)
				1. Modes 4 and 5 use the notion of sentences that form a directed graph, we can use it too
					1. In general sense, if sceptics use X as weapon then X is allowed against sceptics.
				2. These modes don't invoke arguments about the nature of language nor they hint at a need of perfect language, and they use language, therefore deeming it valid
			2. Mode 1 - Discord is solved thus:
				1. Insofar as human dissent is a sufficient reason for scepticism, human agreement is correspondingly sufficient reason for lack of it
				2. For a given spatiotemporal sphere of human life agreement on statement X defuses the discord mode locally
				3. Prrhus limited the dissent to those that he esteemed, hence we do not need to include all humans
					1. Sextus Empiricus, _Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis_ i., from Annas, J., _Outlines of Scepticism_ [Cambridge University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press "Cambridge University Press"). (2000).
				4. He outlines 2 spheres, 'ordinary life' and 'among philosophers'. For binary logic that creates 2x2 model of truthiness of every statement
			3. Mode 2 - Infinite regress isn't possible as utterable explanations for each event are finite	
				1. 	H < I < J < K where H = sequences observed in this instance, 	I = all ever under observation, J = all ever uttered, also non-observed, K = all possible(?). Vide 			1953, second edition 1961, Willard Van Orman Quine, ‘From a logical point of view. Logico - philosophical essays’, page 53
				2. 	We can construct a subset of K where the length of each sequence is limited to n characters.
				3. 	By setting that limit to be equal to 410 pages, we get Borgesian Library of Babel
				4. 	It is self-evident that all sequences of philosophical dispute can have their 'core' contained within such limit - 
					1. 	That we call 'knowledge set' (KS)
				5. 	Insofar as the *infinite regress* argument posits existence of non-terminating read sequence of a directed graph of sentence - nodes, with the set K being finite such non-termination is reducible to mode 5 - circular argument.
			4. 	Mode 5 - circular argument 
				1. 	Is not an independent statement, it implies mode 4, as there can be many circular graphs inside K.
				2. 	Given 2 selections from set K, one circular one linear, both failing under the accusation of mode 4, we can see that 4th is alleviated by self-support
				3. 	That is rhizomaticity
					1. 	 @Outsideness on twitter >[ "Circularity" just means self-grounding, or -- dynamically -- self-propelling. A circular "argument" is stronger (i.e. more independent) than a non-circular one. If you don't have a circle, you have arbitrary axioms.](https://twitter.com/Outsideness/status/1037895001185824768) 
					2. 	 Yet for any *new* thing to appear, a rapture of circularity is needed
						1. 	 	Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 122 >The paranoid Pharaoh and the passional Hebrew? In the case of the Jewish people, a group of signs detaches from the Egyptian imperial network of which it was a part and sets off down a line of flight into the desert, pitting the most authoritarian of subjectivities against despotic signifiance, the most passional and least interpretive of delusions against interpretational paranoid delusion, in short, a linear "proceeding and grievance" against the irradiating circular network. Your grievance, your proceeding: that is Moses' word to his people, and the proceedings come one after the other along a line of Passion. From this Kafka derives his own conception of querulousness or the proceeding, and the succession of linear segments:the father-proceeding, hotel-proceeding, ship-proceeding, court-proceeding.
						2. 	 	 Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 250 >That is how we sorcerers operate. Not following a logical order, but following alogical consistencies or compatibilities. The reason is simple. It is because no one, not even God, can say in advance whether two borderlines will string together form a fiber, whether a given multiplicity will or will not cross over into another given multiplicity, or even if given heterogeneous elements willenter symbiosis, will form a consistent, or cofunctioning, multiplicity sus-ceptible to transformation. No one can say where the line of flight will pass:Will it let itself get bogged down and fall back to the Oedipal family animal,a mere poodle? Or will it succumb to another danger, for example, turning into a line of abolition, annihilation, self-destruction, Ahab,Ahab... ?Weare all too familiar with the dangers of the line of flight, and with its ambi-guities. The risks are ever-present, but it is always possible to have the good fortune of avoiding them.
			5. 	 Mode 3 - relativism
				1. 	 It's the uncertainity about our H being wrong relative to K
				2. 	 By saying more things, we copy into H from J and K
				3. 	 K contains descriptions of any possible world - including the noumena
				4. 	 Is Pyrrho's scepticism particular to the world he finds himself in or does he preclude any possible world? 
				5. 	 Full knowledge game - we can know in the deepest sense things we ourselves invent
				6. 	 We can have true contextual knowledge
			6. 	 Mode 4 - unfounded assumption
				1. 	 For every Knowledge System (KS) we can reduce it to a number of axioms further irreducible (_Gödel_), which we call KSK, which is KS-Kernel
				2. 	The choice which are fundamental and which are derived is arbitrary. [Such as in this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant#Number_of_fundamental_constants).	
				3. 	Unfoundedness is ultimately inescapable, all possible justifications lie inside K.
				4. 	In rejection of solipsism we saw Nature. She forbids us from having an arbitrary KS through multitude of boundary conditions.
				5. 	The most fundamental is about discrimination
					1. 	 >Differentiation between what is ‘good’ and ‘bad’ requires discrimination. This is a capability no younger than life itself, which it serves as an indispensable function. As soon as there is behavior, there is discrimination between alternatives. One way leads to survival, the other way leads to death. There is nourishment, or not reproduction, or not safety or predatory menace. Good and bad, or the discrimination between them (which is the same thing), are etched primordially into any world that life inhabits. Discrimination is needed to survive. ---from XS, discrimination
		2. Dealing with R. Chisholm's problem of criterion
			1. Under this formalization question 1 is equal to choosing KSK and propagating forward to include more nodes from into KS until it's possible
				1. Criteria include being circular and providing means to discrimination, and fitting into 410 pages book
			2. And question 2 is equal to backtracking from a given member of H into KS ergo KSK
			3. Answer to the problem is easy with the widely accepted [ordinary language philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/ord-lang/#H5). Knowing is a language game, not priviledged one.
				1. Further answer to question 1 is that knowledge is not limited to usual agents
					1. Stanislaw Lem in his Summa Technologica presents (p189) a quasi - Wittgensteinian understanding of language - a protocol of communication in not even a linguistic community, but rather for the whole material system. 
					2. [AI can create its own languages now]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_creation_in_artificial_intelligence#:~:text=In%20artificial%20intelligence%2C%20researchers%20can,tokens%20in%20a%20generated%20language.
				2. Communcation protocols - _language games_ are nested within each other
				3. There are zoom in - zoom out dynamics, like [Arcimboldian paintings](https://iep.utm.edu/ord-lang/#:~:text=.%20The%20argument%20can,2005%3B%20Borg%202004).)
				4. The more defined context the more clear semantics is (BTC protocol)
				5. The more you zoom out, the more context depoendent is the word
				6. Intelligebility of communication relies thus also on being in the same Universe, with same constants - 
					1. Radio conversation with aliens across spacetime is the ultimate context limit in our Universe
					2. The smallest context limit is an electron flip only needing to happen in a specific location. Tiny bit elsewhere and information wouldn't be seen
		3. Scope limtation - minimal working arrangement
			1. Rejection means practical abandonment, not absolute rejection
			2. The goal was to establish possibility of true knowledge in local conditions
			3. There is no guarantee to reach the final context of Nature
		4. As Borges said, [ Nothing is built on stone; All is built on sand, but we must build as if the sand were stone.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/367840-nothing-is-built-on-stone-all-is-built-on-sand?page=2) 
	3. We can put our statements into networks of relations - webs like Indra's Net / Quine's Web
		1. By cofrequency of usage #problematic
		2. The process of memetic succession is what Hegel hints at with thesis-antithesis-synthesis
			1. Set of statements in a framework n+1 successive to framework n isn't a superset of statements in n. Not only about a different core, or focus. Some statements are lost, some not responded to. Only the main weakness of n needs to be addressed in n+1.
			2. With varying response coefficients there is no guarantee of statement web converging in time, or even exhibiting a long term increase in complexity
		3. Each web puts each statement into various non-exhaustive groups
			1. Axiomatic
			2. Certain, clsoe to axiom
			3. Plausible but not central
			4. Wrong on the face of it, ignorant but harmless
			5. Wrong and dangerous
		4. There is latency in acquiring new statements - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_(belief_revision)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_(belief_revision)) 
			1. There always exists the least-invasive action path to incorpore a new statement
		5. [There are many paths to each statement ](https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/kavanaugh-vs-the-intellectual-dark-web-4768d959a25c) 
		6. Modeling of web growth is hard, full of pitfalls
			1. > Human knowledge is not (or does not follow) a straight line, but a curve, which endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment, section of this curve can be transformed (transformed one-sidedly) into an independent, complete, straight line, which then (if one does not see the wood for the trees) leads into the quagmire, into clerical obscurantism (where it is anchored by the class interests of the ruling classes). ---[Lenin, Summary of Dialectics (1914) ](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/quotes.htm) 
			2. An example in a conversation
				1. A talks with B, there is stated some dilemma
				2. A and B have 2 different solutions
				3. Each is supported with some statement from the *common sense* statement pool
				4. Each is discovered to have some consequence
				5. The consequence of A's statement is detrimental to, or devalues some shared value.
				6. The discourse stops at choosing B's answer to the dilemma
		7. There can be various relationships between webs happening over time
			1. Symbiotic - one-or-both-sided flow of nodes
			2. Merging
			3. Destruction - extermination of carrier forms of nodes, eventually leading to death of a web
				1. Eg [Qin Shi Huang's policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars)
			4. Competition - between truth and falsity accounts of a node or between different justifiations for what both consider true
			5. Socratic dialectics is a form of high speed transmission
				1. It requires special conditions, of material abundance and spatiotemporal proximity of speakers
				2. Can be very slow over historical scales
					1. Eg [Communication over centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Incoherence)
		8. When considered on individual level
			1. Webs are in a quantum state until contested by a factor outside the carrier
				1. The netural quantum state is at tension with formulated creeds - lists of tenets, which act as conditioning
			2. Speed of self-examination, conflict resolution and intgration is limited by material conditions
				1. In the example of the web of modern science, or even narrowing it down the process can go like this
					1. New paper is released
					2. Paper is received in some way by the community
					3. Conflicts are detected
					4. Conflicts are resolved
				2. An indication of teh speed can be seen in the idea that [‘science progresses one funeral at a time'](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6814193/) 
				3. This is about conversations / thoughts / instructions per second. 
				4. Only so many messages, conversations can happen
				5. Only so many people can communicate on a certain level of sophistication in a given milieu
				6. There can be 'vaccination' against certain ideas - priming potential recipients against them
				7. Lazy evaluation of beliefs increases in latency in scarcity conditions
				8. They crystallize quite fast, about 20 years of age can be already quite rigid			
			3. Some of the even key parts of the web can often be R M Hare's bliks, only eschatologically verifiable
			4. Every Plato has their noble lie
				1. Form some POV a contradiction between practice and theory. 
				2. The more thought is only an abstract disinterested inquiry the more it it risks exhibiting this property when put into action
		9. What we can say about any web at the point n in time
			1. They were [successful in surviving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_State) until now
			2. It is unprepared for most of possible futures
			3. A different web evolution would lead the statement carrier into different places, yet opinion of the new place would also be judged by changed criteria
			4. It is almost certain that current web is not optimal
			5. For webs there exists an exploration - exploitation tradeoff
		10. Socratic conversation is competitive web building
			1. Here a common pattern
				1. A paradox or question is presented, such as if [‘virtue can be taught’](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics-shorter/#8)
				2. Presents two views that are mutually exclusive
				3. Conseqences of each are developed
				4. These form a web of nodes, with relations of support or contradiction
				5. One of the options is rejected or the conversation is interrupted
			2. Degrees of attachment to beliefs in Quine's web are gradually decreasing upon exposure to foreign elements.
		11. Webs don't have to be [dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_graph)
			1. A perons's total web can have regions connected only by a few threads.
			2. Epistemological anarchism sees science as very sparse, and making tight connections as detrimental
			3. Long established philosophical and religious traditions can be expected to be explored into a dense graph most likely
			4. Dense growth and filling in the gaps corresps to Kuhnian normal science
	4. These networks divide fractally into language games. The words for language games that are established and large in the number of adherents are: metanarrative, memeplex, brainworm, ideology, lifestance, egregore, religion. Webs of statements are physical entities, to varying degree embedded in social reality.
		1. Metanarratives are dynamic, not set in stone and are not planned 
			1. The old robotic view is that you choose a set of beliefs tha map to outputs, yet these outputs do not modify the beliefs themselves. As a result, the beliefs are completely static.
			2. Metanarratives aren't a timeless Dao, way of life, or way of society. 
				1. 'Atheism' isn't a metanarrative, it's an abstract position. New Atheism is a movement - metanarrative that goes beyond a solely abstract position.
				2. Metanarrative isn't *synonymous* with *culture*, Metanarrative is more active and deals with the conscious beliefs of adherents, culture is more emergent.
					1. A city can have many religious communities inside (metanarratives, dealing with ), yet having its own specific culture, which is a result of the interplay. 
					2. You can walk through a city and see its culture.
				3. The planned view of metanarratives was characteristic of Enlightenment, visible in notions of *tabula rasa*, and *homo oeconomicus*
			3. Jordan B. Peterson, Maps of Meaning: the Architecture of Belief (1999) 173 > No static political utopia is therefore possible, in consequence – and the kingdom of god remains spiritual, not worldly. Recognition of the essentially ambivalent nature of the predictable – stultifying, but secure – means discarding simplistic theories which attribute the existence of human suffering and evil purely to the state, or which presume that the state is all that is good, and that the individual should exist merely as subordinate or slave. The king is a wall. Walls provide a barrier to the sudden influx of the unknown, and block progress forward. One function presupposes the other (although either may certainly come to dominate).
		2. Metanarratives are neither entirely random nor perfectly adapted to environments. And can never be like that, be final.
			1. If all were perfectly adapted, we couldn't compare them
				1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 117: "As if every great doctrine were not a combined formation, constructed from bits and pieces, various intermingled codes and flux, partial elements and derivatives, that constitute its very life or its becoming."
			2. They form environment to each other
			3. If they were random there would be no reason to choose one over the other
			4. As memeplexes are nonlinear systems, there are many butterfly effects
			5. Interconnection creates more homogenous meme landscape. 
			6. Isolation creates greater diversity 
				1. Vide islands vs plains in biology
			7. Randomness has a source in human A to B communication
				1. Follows from the `Chinese whispers` experiment
				2. We can define successful communication A to B as B rephrasing A's utterance and A accepting it as faithful approximation. Percent of semantic content judged to be correct ideally approaches 1 with length of exchange
			8. Human history was *particular* and path dependent, not universal and optimized.
				1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 224 > The only universal history is the history of contingency. Let us return to this eminently contingent question that modern historians know how to ask: why Europe, why not China? Apropos of ocean navigation, Fernand Braudel asks: why not Chinese, Japanese, or even Moslem ships? Why not Sinbad the Sailor? It is not the technique, the technical machine, that is lacking. Isn't it rather that desire remains caught in the nets of the despotic State, entirely invested in the despot's machine? "Perhaps then the merit of the West, confined as it was on its narrow 'Cape of Asia,' was to have needed the world, to have needed to venture outside its own front door." The schizophrenic voyage is the only kind there is. (Later this will be the American meaning of frontiers: something to go beyond, limits to cross over, flows to set in motion, noncoded spaces to enter.) 
			9. Any arguments against randomness are of 3 types 
				1. Revelation - will not respond here
				2. Rational inquiry - see statement 9 in the Metanarratives section
				3. Invisible hand - emergent truth arguments - see statement statement 8
			10. Invisible hand argument is correct to some extent. There was strong selection for *usefulness* as a political tool, and also self-spreading.
				1. Spinza's Ethics, PART III. ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS, proposition 31 corollary > Corollary.—From the foregoing, and also from III. xxviii. it follows that everyone endeavours, as far as possible, to cause others to love what he himself loves, and to hate what he himself hates: as the poet says: "As lovers let us share every hope and every fear: ironhearted were he who should love what the other leaves."
			11. Most mutations are random and deleterious
			12. Unless scarcity is very strong and sudden, all organisms support some parasites, such as deleterious mutations.
			13. Mode of distribution of a metanarrative is intristically linked to its contents
			14. Stochastic events like fires destroy knowledge with no bias
			15. Per Hardy Weinberg hypothesis, we have 5 factors of change: mutation, non random mating, gene flow, genetic drift, natural selection
			16. Web of statements is the 'genome' of an individual and has corresponding 5 factors of change
				1. Moses' horns were a result of meme mutation in an unreliable carrier
				2. 'Mating' - Memes co-occur with one another:
					1. Depending on objective correlation - conscientousness or open mindedness of carriers might favour some memes more than others
					2. Depending on chance
						1. Person getting a random book recommendation from a friend
				3. Gene flow - just memes from other networks / memeplexes
				4. Genetic drift - founder effects from personalities and quirks of founders of religions, companies and organizations
					1. [People with unusual cognitive architecture / biographies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_delusion) play key roles. They were sometimes called crazy. They were prophets and philosophers. They introduce randomness. 
				5. Natural selection - in humans has two facets - population growth (vertical) and long distance communication (horizontal)
					1. In a long lived species on a slow metabolism planet or creatures such as elves the horizontal would dominate, as would between superintelligences
						1. Whales learning is another example
						2. Cephalopods where the parent dies on offspring delivery are left to this mode
						3. Werther and copycat suicide
					2. Vertical is the only option left to lower animals, easily turns from meme to gene
					3. Horizontal can lead to quite successful memetic parasites, yet at the same time more short lived
					4. Vertical is closer to Nature, as it is filtered through more experience, yet might be stuck on ocal maxima
						1. Mormonism is a great example of a successful vertical model
			17. Randomness factors can't cancel each other out to give us perfect adaptation
			18. Sociology of scientific knowledge spoke enough about this, for a stark example see [the oil drop experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment)
			19. Hume's state on randomness and contingency of science > Those who cultivate the sciences in any state, are always few in number: The passion, which governs them, limited: Their taste and judgment delicate and easily perverted: And their application disturbed with the smallest accident. Chance, therefore, or secret and unknown causes, must have a great influence on the rise and progress of all the refined arts. Hume, RP 7, Mil 113-4
		3. Metanarratives are not the only factor in history
			1. This is obvious, stated to avoid Hegelian-ish approach
			2. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia: 68 >(ideology is a most execrable concept obscuring all of the effectively operating social machines).
			3. >The true political shape of any given country is not to be found in the wording of its constitution; it is rather, the unwritten, unconscious laws according to which the constitution is put into effect. (Spengler, 1967: 71)
		4. Metanarratives matter correspondingly to their level of success
			1. The most basic criterium of success if whether they bring what they promise - if they are [self fulfilling prophecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Will_to_Believe). 
			2. There are various stage of success
				1. Uncoordinated memes - when memes don't occur with one another yet, just collide randomly in meme space
					1. We don't know most of them by names
					2. Most marketing is short term and with limited aims, with memes not living for themselves, but the surplus value captured
						1. 'Diamonds are forever'
						2. The smart assistant with avatar popular among online drawing artists
				2. Coordinated memes begin to form from random collisions making some memes stick together, be it by
					1. Similar cognitive architectures of carriers
					2. Similar circles repeating them - *fashion*
					3. The latter is indistinguishable from power
					4. We know of some attempts that failed in the way they tried
						1. Aten cult in Egypt
						2. Gnosticism
						3. French revolution cult of Reason
						4. Auguste Comte's religion of humanity
				3. Metanarrative that succeeds over others
					1. The key tactic is weeding out competition - claiming exclusivity
						1. Monotheism
					2. Another tactic is interception of meme units
						1. Christianity and Greek philosophy
				4. Time - complete metanarrative - the most elusive stage, where metanarrative secures not only horizontally against others, but also in vertical transmission
			3. We can apply Johari window to analyze successes of metanarratives
				1. Simply taken, the exmples are:
					1. Self-known, others-known: capitulation signing treaties, awards given
					2. Self-unknown, others-known, 'blind spot': when it's falling yet not hit the ground
					3. Self-known, others-unknown, 'facade'
					4. Both unknown - many events
				2. We can also differentiate between mere 'winning as being at advantage', in relative terms, from 'winning as accomplishing goals', in subjective terms
					1. 1939 Munich conference was only a relative success to the German government
					2. Workers movements can be split among reformers thinking in relative terms and revolutionaries thinking in subjective terms
					3. The subjective criterion was missed by Akhenaton reforms, while hypotheses are out there that later monotheism had some influence from there
			4. Almost all metanarratives have more people outside of it having an opinion about it than on the inside. These occur on various dimensions:
				1. Friend - enemy distinction, with 'decent even if imperfect' ending up on either side contingently
				2. Approachability 
					1. Trivial - not new, not changing anything 
					2. Defensible - one cannot see reasons against, does not contradict one’s basic values, but is not sufficient to change views - one understands why someone may hold such a view
					3. Persuasive - if one wants to understand the issue and hear it, it makes one think and seriously consider changing one’s views on the matter
					4. [Popularisable](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/viral-marketing.asp) - not only one enjoys knowing the idea, but also wants to spread it and it is easy to remember and communicate 
					5. Livable - idea which is not abstract, upon hearing about it one is able to incorporate some practices in own life
					6. Endurable - upon living the idea, one does not need to stop quickly; no serious integral long - term inconsistencies
					7. Transcendental / evolutionary schemes - the narrative is so fine-tuned to our spiritual / evolutionary underlay that it with cultural reinforcement is followed most easily, effortlessly
				3. Individually variable changes - personality / emotional distance - how one’s personality affects eagerness to embrace a certain belief; relevant characteristics include independence, individualism, etc. There is a difference between a soft and a hard barrier (change needed) to embracing a potential belief:
					1. Soft changes - those that are not controversial to the individual and also not crucial in the belief system; they neither make a Lebensform attractive to a potential believer, nor they repulse them
					2. Hard changes - changes in attitude that are psychologically uneasy, counterintuitive, usually happen only after a spiritual / traumatic / learning experience
					3. Beliefs distance - how one’s present beliefs stand in relation to a potential Lebensform; how many align, how many oppose
					4. Opportunity / environment distance - in practice, even if one found that, e.g. stoicism is the ‘perfect match’, if in their area there were no like minded people, a person might not be able to fully learn everything oneself. 
			5. Metanarratives with the highest relative success - dominant metanarratives has average lower level of knowledge of the other ones details
		5. Metanarratives need to conform to Nature
			1. They have material basis 
				1. As evidenced before by mentions of physical books being destroyed, embodied humans also being their carriers
				2. There is a type of people with huge impact on the development of metanarratives: religious scholars, reformers, state advisors, techers, revolutionary mavericks, traders and nobles
					1. This has exceptions, as even [starting life as a slave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus#Life) does not prevent from philosophical achievement
					2. 1350, French countryside. Twins separated at birth - one becomes a farmer, the other a monk. Both are religious, yet their metanarrative networks are different
				3. Dependence of beliefs on the material world has many types
					1. Empirical knowledge derived from experience
					2. Phineas Gage type cases
						1. [Drunk people are more conservative](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/5-ways-to-turn-a-liberal-into-a-conservative-at-least-until-the-hangover-sets-in) 
						2. 
				4. The obvious result is that as material conditions change, distribution of beliefs change
					1. A subtype of this result is the secularization thesis
				5. Acquiring any specific beliefs has opportunity cost - buying a book, seeing a movie, activity on online forums or physical market squares
				6. In any society with division of labour webs of belief of each memeber will be grouped into clusters around their economic circumstance.
					1. This does not mean value pluralism, outwardly they could profess the same faith, be the same people
				7. We cannot afford economically for everyone to understand, e.g. Hegel
				8. As beliefs and philosophies are integrated into the culture, their acquisition cost lowers substantially.
				9. > ‘Rather than deconstruct belief system, developing complex counternarratives, he argued that you only need to do three things: move them out of their town; get them a job; and get them a girlfriend “The sector as a whole needs to get much better at working out how we deal with the cultural anxiety that people feel when they think about how our societies are changing.” Birdwell says.” = abous some ‘Exit’ deradicalization program [The rise of the far right — the UK’s fastest‑growing terror threat | The Sunday Times Magazine | The Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-rise-of-the-far-right-the-uks-fastest-growing-terror-threat-cm78rx9jb)
			2. As physical entities they have a limited state space in which to exist, we can talk about them as a number of challenges
				1. There are various steps that these can occur at
					1. Passing initial evaluation
					2. Persisting in the web organism for long enough
						1. One of the strategies is to be *useful* in the challenges that the carrier faces
						2. Another strategy is to make the carrier choose different strategies, perhaps more transmissible
					3. Moving onto transmission
						1. Veritcal or horizontal, as discussed above
				2. We can assign challenges to each of the stages
					1. Initial evaluation challenges	
						1. Relativism and scepticism challenge
							1. Plato's Noble Lie - just feeling strong enough to ignore some relativity; pronouncing an exceptionfrom it
							2. Normative relativism
							3. Pointing out hopelessness of scepticism
							4. Admiting ignorance but bracketing it, keeping it contained - in area irrelevant to praxis
						2. Overcoming the previous one
							1. Can be solved by talking to children
							2. Going for easy mode and convincing uncivilized peoples
					2. Persistence challenges / challenges of survival
						1. Coherence challenge
							1. This might be considered from perspective of multiple logics
							2. If your audience has limited investment capacity into what you're saying, be it for intellectual, linguistic or economic reasons, you'll simplify the message to keep coherence. There is cost to transmission of any part of the metanarrative and most people won't learn all the arguments
							3. You can either bracket the areas of low coherence, saying they're axioms or divine mysteries
							4. Or you can manually restrict discourse on some of them - as the speed of belief examination is limited, that is a very viable short term strategy
							5. Wittgenstainian appeal to social convetion and Kantian 'universal a priori' moral trick are both instances of game-theoretic *consistency* of metanarratives. That can be called *escape by the social*.
						2. Verisimilitude challenge
							1. It's about how your metanarrative relates to things 
								1. Already believed by the carrier
								2. Popular in the milieu
							2. Things not prescribed are adiaphoric
							3. A safe strategy is to ban / restrict discourse of adiaphoric items which are orthogonal to positive values of your metanarrative yet if let roam freely might be detrimental to them
						3. Benefit increase challenge
							1. Metanarratives can do this explicitly or implicitly
								1. Franciscan monk preaching on the streets does it explicitly
								2. Prosperity theology Calvinist just exists and serves as proof of his metanarrative
						4. Challenge of multiple interpretations - metanarrative can surivive with its *name* while contents are changed
							1. Decentralization - for redundancy or centralization
							2. Labeling some core as the most important
							3. There is a constant need for re-interpretation, generation of discourse
								1. Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari, p114 > There is one other aspect: the signifying regime is not simply faced with the task of organizing into circles signs emitted from every direction; it must constantly assure the expansion of the circles or spiral, it must provide the center with more signifier to overcome the entropy inherent in the system and to make new circles blossom or replenish the old. Thus a secondary mechanism in the service of signifiance is necessary: interpretance or interpretation. This time the signifier assumes a new figure: it is no longer the amorphous continuum that is given without being known and across which the network of signs is strung. 
								2. Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari, p114 >The interpretive priest, the seer, is one of the despot-god's bureaucrats. A new aspect of deception arises, the deception of the priest: interpretation is carried to infinity and never encounters anything to interpret that is not already itself an interpretation. The signified constantly reimparts signifier, recharges it or produces more of it.
						5. Cost reduction challenge = challenge of human condition
							1. Hedonic treadmill
								1. Setting the target far enough - such as afterlife
								2. Shifting attention from target to way
								3. Shifting attentionfrom hedonism to other targets
					3. Moving onto transmission challenges
						1. Challenge of sending your best to convince
							1. There are various strategies ehre, high birth rate, conversion at various distances and means
						2. Making a follower also a spreader
							1. Wearing merchandise
							2. Making the benefits very visible - a fakeable signal
			3. More abstract beliefs are less determined by Nature, so more variation among them is allowed
				1. 'Naive realism' is the obvious, undisputable common part of webs of belief in a society
					1. [That is the 'two truths doctrine'"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarities_between_Pyrrhonism_and_Buddhism)
				2. From the POV of society, each web has some nodes in the naive realism set, the rest like a tree growing from there towards more abstract beliefs.
				3. Children, and humanity in its youth at some point notice that others have differences in their belief web.
					1. That causes pre-scientific investigation of reasons to know things (Sceptics) and engineering methods for dealing with the web (logical investigations of the Stoics)
					2. There is a deep insight that can happen to young people - of abolsute alienness of people who think differently, have the web network wired differently. It's more insidious and in a way paranoidal than visible differences.
				4. Society ALWAYS punishes deviation from the norm of the lower - level beliefs - you end up in a straitjacket
				5. More difference is possible with the higher - level beliefs
					1. They are less deterministic, allowing choice
					2. Can change more often, both in persons and social aggregate
					3. A set of voluntary options that each increase in complexity proportionally to time studied is the perfect `store of status`
					4. Differences in the more abstract beliefs are more punished in the states called totalitarian ones.
				6. Plato questioned naive realism, ending up with Platonic realism
				7. Evolutionary apparatus evolved for social and psycho spatial reasoning, not examination of its own architecture. 
				8. Any explicity meme we can (theoretically) trace back to some image, sound or thought. Worldview is dependent on observation. There is always non-representative sample of information. A choice between random beliefs seems not only not inappropriate - but inevitable. This is about the [nihilism](https://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/#H2)Nietzsche warned about.
				9. Socratic conversation, philosophical thought in general is an exploration of belief space
				10. The more resources are commited into exploration, the more it subverts the assumption of non-representative sample of information
					1. This converts the absolute 'belief space', into a veiny structure of already explored beliefs and a proximate region of possible-yet not explored in depth
					2. We can construct a derivative of region wrt resources commited
					3. Questions that will be solved by 8 to 10 billion humans in the next 80 years is such a region
					4. By saying 'I have thought enough, and these answers must be final in this world', a person indicates us their estimation of the possible belief - space
						1. Belief space is smaller if you give more specific bounds, it doesn't have to be timeless
						2. An old chief of a dying tribe has less belief options
						3. Level of technology also influences what options are even considered
						4. There is an overall drive towards wider and wider applications
					5. Is it a small blue dot of beliefs in the sea of belief space? This leads to many parallels with cosmic arguments
						1. Doomsday argument, Rare Earth hypothesis
					6. The question is - how necessarily emergent are the structures we encounter locally relative to the whole space?
					7. To think that it's not that necessary is cosmic horror
					8. There is a RW idea, that there is little to no space for 'human value judgement', 
						1. That instrumental truths subsume all value claims given time.
						2. This assumes the belief space given human options is quite small, already having been explored, options where [insert system of choice] stopped working all ending in a catastrophe
						3. This is the opposite of cosmic horror
						4. Something not far from this is Singularitarian / Hegelian / Marxist historical determinism, just going in exponentials, not circles
				11. Metanarratives create machinery in the free space unoccupied in the immediate Nature's requirements, to suit units to their needs - things beyond the reach of units through no fault on their own
			4. There are many common strategies adapted by metanarratives to thrive - either through common origin, horizontal transfer or convergent evolution
				1. Conflation of is and ought - see the point above Gnon
				2. Restoring balance - When a principle is observed as true in all the time but recent ones, very often the barrier beyong living memory
					1. This often takes a form of a lost paradise
						1. Neo-Reactionary view of the French Revolution
						2. Christians and Eden
						3. Vegans and 'only humans drink other species' milk'
						4. IDW and the 90s
						5. Rashidun Caliphate
						6. Land of Israel (one of the few instances where the lost was regained)
						7. 50s traditional American life
						8. 19th century laissez faire
						9. Gold standard
						10. Hunter gatherer matriarchy
						11. Primitive communism
						12. Ethnostates
					2. But also entirely novel paradises
						1. Days of Judgement in various religions
						2. "Imagine there's no heaven"
					3. You can't imagine non-specific utopia, it will always be a photo-negative of the failture modes you see most often around you
				3. [Everyone assigned some sphere of responsibility](https://twitter.com/PYeerk/status/1387471282120318977) 
				4. 'As our follower you need to scrutinize your preconceptions according to our precepts’
				5. [Ur-facist ideas also applies - just read it with the 2010-2020s progressivism in mind instead of 1930s European fascism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism) 
				6. Ideal attitudes, the paragons and saints to become similar to [ideal attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ethics)#Creation_of_ideals_in_the_psyche)
				7. Responses to important [questions](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ETERQUES.html) in philosophy and in the minds of the common folk 
			5. We introduce degree correctedness of a network. 
				1. It is similarity to the 'most correct' the accepted state of the art network examination, with high verisimilitude wrt all explored beliefs, and potential new ones
					1. Of course, many beliefs (potentially infinite) can form that set
					2. But there are communication bandwidth limits which truncate the set towards more Occkham-razor-compliant configuration
				2. Then this correctedness set doesn't need to be the same as 'what feels right' / what feels good / what gives meaning - in fact that would be an extremely unlikely and degenerate case
				3. Ergo the correct memes would spread less well than the 'feel right ones', if local region of belief space is large enough
					1. Local region of belief space is proportional to resources available, things like war quickly restrict that space
			6. Another strategy is to corrupt the youth, put unformed networks on path dependent life trajectories where they benefit you throughout
			7. 'Capturing' ideologically only some few people, and having most of the impact by influencing all hereby
				1. That's vanguardism and shifting Overton window
			8. Victim card and fortress syndrome
				1. Repeating past oppressions, current one and future risk
				2. Makes appear innocent to the outside
				3. Makes ingroup paranoidal and encourages flocking
				4. Paints enemies of varying reality
				5. EVERY GROUP HAS ONE
				6. Victim narratives focused on the past
					1. Atheists: religious persecution 
					2. LGBT: social stigma, forced therapies
					3. Christians: persecution in Christian minority countries
					4. Jews: the Holocaust
					5. Communists / working class: 19th century, before worker protection laws, in the UK before Thatcherite reforms 
					6. The rich / libertarians: taxes, treatment of kulaks in USSR
					7. White nationalists: Rhodesia, Confederacy
				7. Victim narratives focused on the present
					1. Atheists: non - religious councillors in hospitals, any presence of religion in the state
					2. LGBT: social unacceptance
					3. Christians: emptying churches, persecution in Christian minority countries
					4. Jews: rising anti semitism
					5. White nationalists: white genocide theories
					6. Communists / working class: inequalities
					7. The rich / libertarians: taxes, totalitarian state
			9. Division on the world into friend and enemy
				1. Historical examples
					1. In European antiquity: [barbaric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian#In%20classical%20Greco-Roman%20Contexts) - 
					2. In medieval Europe: [heatheGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism#Heathen)\
				2. Modern examples
					1. Atheists: secular, rational world vs religious anachronistic (eg 'flyover country') 
					2. LGBT:  safe space. Literally. Also, campuses.
					3. Christians: James 1, 27 
					4. Muslims: [‘Dar al Islam’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisions_of_the_world_in_Islam) 
					6. White nationalists: the ‘Western civilization’ vs 'globalist pawns and elites'
					7. Communists / working class: 99% vs 1% 
					8. The rich / libertarians: hard working vs social parasites (these hide views the most)
					9. By US international relations: The ‘international community’ as opposed to ‘rogue states’ (DPRK, Iran)
				3. [Structuring of the outside of the metanarrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) is one of its most important tasks. Everyone is exclusivist. 
				4. Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari, 422  > The definition of the Unspecified Enemy testifies to this: "multiform, maneuvering and omnipresent... of the moral, political, subversive or economic order, etc.," the unassignable material Saboteur or human  Deserter assuming the most diverse forms."' 
			10. Monocausal explanations - many eople need to feel everything is explained and for low IQ low spare time, you arrive at monocausal explanations - that someone takes care of or you can do something
			11. Average adherent feels more *empowered*, mattering more, whether to the world or themselves - every bad thing in the world is either - average adherent feels more *empowered*, mattering more, whether to the world or themselves
				1. - healed by someone competent on your side 
				2. - improvable by your action
			12. Relies on [Emotional contagion to create group strutrue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_contagion) 
			13. Another strategy is [propaganda of success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_success) - some attainment (of endurance or skill), is lauded as for everyone. Even if a very limited % of the listeners are ever able to achieve these, you put unrealistic expectations
			14. Conformity to nature depends in on resource scarcity in the place of birth. A metanarrative will not fare well in places with different patterns of abundances and scarcities
				1. Ancient myths were very conforming to nature, probably as well as human ideas have so far
					1. Maps of meaning, Jordan B Peterson, page 188, > The consequence of this mutual modification, operating over time, is the emergence of a stable pattern of behavior, “designed” to match individual and social needs, simultaneously. Eventually, this behavioral pattern comes to be coded in image, heralded in narrative, and explicitly represented in words. In the integrated individual – or the integrated state – action, imagination and explicit verbal thought are isomorphic: explicit and image- mediated beliefs and actual behaviors form a coherent unit. Verbal theories of morality (explicit rules) match traditional images of moral behavior, and action undertaken remains in concordance with both. This integrated morality lends predictability to behavior, constitutes the basis for the stable state, and helps ensure that emotion remains under control. 
					2. Also see indirect coordination, in insects, [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy)
			15. Jordan B. Peterson, Maps of Meaning: the Architecture of Belief (1999) 185-186 > As such, a given cultural structure necessarily must meet a number of stringent and severely constrained requirements: (1) it must be self-maintaining (in that it promotes activities that allow it to retain its central form); (2) it must be sufficiently flexible to allow for constant adaptation to constantly shifting environmental circumstances; and (3) it must acquire the allegiance of the individuals who compose it. [...] Furthermore, the group solution must appear ideal – in comparison to any or all actual or imaginable alternatives. The compelling attractiveness of simplistic utopian ideologies, even in the “skeptical” twentieth century, is evidence for the stringent difficulty of this final requirement. 
		6. Metanarratives care about different things to varying degrees
			1. Beliefs similarity is an important similarity measure between societies
			2. Let's imagine a graph of care / feelings of obligation / belonging in 2 dimensions of social distance and time. The result is has colours indicating indexity, time on x axis and social distance represented on y axis
				1. Social distance has the basis in everyday human experience: me, we, they
					1. Socially, these are '[circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanding_Circle)', in this graph can be a line
				2. Time axis has basis in time preference and 
			3. The widest possible graph includes
				1. Wide 'entity' / social distance list
					1. Intention - momentary assertion - personal habit, want, - sub-self: ‘me as a member of X professional, member of Y group’ - ‘the self’  - most important 5 people (friends and /or family)  - immediate group - 30 people  - [network of acquaintances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) - 150 - city  - region  - ethnicity  - nation  - ‘great nation’  - race  - civilization  - own species  - animals with higher cognitive apparatus / aliens - all sentient creatures  - non sentient fauna  - non-animal life  - abiotic environment  - the universe / God-like entities // these two might be separate, in polytheistic it’s different
					2. Feelings and mechanisms at the 5 to 30 level have a much higher selection for similarity than city / ethnicity
					3. This might not be entirely linear
				2. Wide list of relatinos in time
					1. - ‘the higher order’ - the physical universe - the oldest human tales - ancient texts  - centuries of tradition  - universalistic notions of the past  - ‘blood of the fallen’  - local traditions, folklore  - memory of passed relatives  - short-term traditions  - immediate now  - delayed gratification (up to months usually)  - transfer of resources (above 1 year, up to 10)  - personal gamble (10-50 years)  - hiper generational (50-200 years) supplement this with personal life extension?  - historic (200-10 000 years)  - cosmic - to infinity  - transcendent - timeless
					2. This is more arbitrarily asymmetric 
					3. Each metanarrative posits some limits to knowledge about those events, sets an [event horizoGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon) beyond which speculation and giving precepts is futile.
					4. Important distinction may appear between narratives in how does the pattern of importance of each event horizon relate to the concept of [hyperbolic discounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting). 
			4. There are other axes to compare
		7. Metanarratives aren't the same for every adherent
			1. There are various statistics about the demographics of each metanarrative
				1. Based on a belief survey, we can measure degree of difference in verisimilitude between the [priest class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest) and [common believers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifunctional_hypothesis). 
				2. Different metanarratives might have different degree of susceptivility to diseases and relations to [personality disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_delusion)
				3. Average time of membership by a follower should be a defining metric, social dynamics of [sects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociological_classifications_of_religious_movements#Church-sect_typology) being different from other forms, also see [Microculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microculture) 
				4. Percentage of nominal adherents, and active practictioners in public (possible Western bias here)
				5. Robustness - [emotional resilience of followers](https://journals.lww.com/co-psychiatry/Abstract/2014/09000/The_role_of_religion_and_spirituality_in_mental.9.aspx) - e.g. stoicism would score high, while immature hedonism not 
			2. Of the time-dependent differences between adherents say the historical parameters of metanarratives
				1. The date of creation of these ideas
				2. Famous people connected to it, 
				3. Names of books and pop culture references 
				4. List of works, theory behind - books, philosophers, prophets
				5. Ability to attract new followers after the death of their leader
				6. Being an object of continued interest of thinkers
				7. Political stability in the moment of formation; periods of flourishing and comparison with chaotic times
			3. No-correspondence thesis - ‘There is no a priori proportional relation between the importance (number of connections) of a given belief in a belief web and its place in the everyday mind of the follower.’ 
				1. These are differently evolving entities
				2. At best the follower's network is a subset of the metanarrative network, but overtrained on their personal experience set
			4. It's hard to account for human need for myths and meaning without the supernatural in the narratives
			5. A text might be hold long in high esteem when the minds are already governeed by new words
			6. In the past the fact of metanarratives consisting of many books was by lower population and the ideas had to account for a smaller number of facts in the world. Now complexity (of what we discovered + created), skyrocketed, so more idea nodes are needed. 
			7. Never do we find metanarratives in their pure form in nature. We can try to isolate their elements, though.
			8. Manifestos are the best that can be hoped for. People hear that it’s most well known and read, assuming the rest to [insert metanarrative] is only some theoretical details
				1. Marxists complain about their opponents judging them by the original manifesto
		8. Metanarratives compete and evolve, yet not on a marketplace of ideas, among the 'nonfree' factors power is the foremost	
			1. This follows from statements 5 and 7
			2. Further support comes from Foucauldian analysis
			3. If one was to outline a possible evolutionary tree of Lebensformen, it might contain elements like this; each of them is different psychologically. 
				1. Primitive - since the dawn of language, abstract thinking - needed by tribes hunter gatherers thousands of years ago; reign agent detection 
				2. Independently constructed - [Sheilalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheilaism); not consulted, story of Abraham abandoning own city; in some cases the individual is deemed insane by the others
				3. Philosophical - ones that underwent severe scrutiny, Cartesian system
				4. Tribal - an emphasis on hierarchy, possibly animism, lack of dialectics
				5. Individually read out of sources - lone reading and lone thoughts, e.g. someone practising modern Stoicism by combining line reading of Marcus Aurelius ‘Meditations’ with one’s own thoughts
				6. Communitarily read out of sources - reading texts in the context and according to the beliefs of a particular group
				7. Unreflective following of the clergy
				8. Popular in youth groups - differ from tribal in their greater volatility
				9. A sectarian ([according to the sect-denomination-church distinctioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociological_classifications_of_religious_movements)) -  a comparatively small group, for its size it has not had many great thinkers, nor it has developed a serious apologetics
				10. A denomination (according to the sect-denomination-church distinction) - combines features of sects and churches in a median degree
				11. A church (according to the sect-denomination-church distinction) - has a wide ranging literature on many topics, sophisticated answers to numerous criticism, several renowned thinkers have already written in its spirit
				12. A past-height church - has some good old writings, but contemporary population is too small, so does not have adequate up-to date responses; documents the decay
			4. Note: it’s not a linear progress, these are niches, to be filled with various specimen at different points in time. Just as evolution does not have inherent aim, here any stage is not superior.
		9. Metanarratives aren't constructed on the basis of some hypothetical set of facts known to all men - they are contingent
			1. This follows from 1 and 5 
		10. Metanarratives aren't escapable - aren't finally comparable with one another from some 'vantage point' - the only comparisons can be from our POV.
			1. Middle ground can't be judged between them, as that relies on a 1d view and a 2d triangle projected on 1d can have 3 different middles
			2. Metanarrative is the *kernel*, the [intepretive community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretive_communities) 
			3. Odo Marquard, In Praise of Polytheism > Mythonudism strives for something impossible; because, it seems to me, every demythologization is a well compensated process: the more myths one takes off, the more myths stay on. That is why I have doubts about the striptease: doubts (to put it more precisely) about the idea of the enlightenment (late in world history) as a striptease operating with myths. 
			4. At best attempts at escape result in centralization
				1. Odo Marquard, In Praise of Polytheism > a monomyth of this sort is the most successful myth of the modern world: the myth of the inexorable progress of world history toward freedom, in the form of the philosophy of history based on the idea of revolutionary emancipation. That—Lévi-Strauss calls it the "myth of the French Revolution"—is a monomyth. Contrary to historicist principles, it suffers no stories beside this one emancipatory world history. Here it becomes apparent that, although one cannot abolish myths, or stories, it is possible, by establishing a monopolistic myth, to centralize and thus depluralize them.
		11. Mere existence of opponents to a metanarrative is a sign of its failure. The victory needs to be total. In the dialogue, there are only limited possible situations
			1. Definitions
				1. A, B - two points of view, webs 
				2. Cx = common ground from the point of view x.
				3. Ca does not equal Cb.
			2. The following conclusions
				1. Would not work = of inconsistency of B with Ca descriptive (‘based on flawed theoretical assumptions’
				2. Would be bad for subjects / believers = of inconsistency of B with Ca normative
				3. Would be outcompeted = like the ‘not work’ one, but not in absolute terms, but relatively; inferior performance to other (C, D), points of view. That means to A descriptive, as that’s where are A keeps views on C and D. Includes economical, memetic, etc competition.
				4. Would work, but would ‘throw something under the bus’ = inconsistency of B with some normative thing, Ca or A
				5. Problem of transition = that B normative final goal is consistent with A (not just Ca!), but that actions required to reach it. These actions are B normative not
				6. Final, action precepts stemming from specific descriptive statements (SDS) at present. Then the criticism may be redirected to the transition state itself (possibly each of the other types, if SDS belongs to Ca )or the descriptive (SDS not in Ca).
			3. In criticism of a belief network you may encounter points on which it is agnostic and uninvested in, denying validity to anything said about that - that is `ideological stopping point`
				1. The way to escape this local maximum is to go beyond that point without support, to later come back
				2. Denial of thought means bringing it again
					1. You won't be able to prevent the thought you don't like from arising again
				3. In many cases the better strategy is to admit the thought and incorporate into the network, but that it not always possible without 'salt losing its taste'
				4. There are various examples
					1. Solipsism can be rejected only with significant overhead compared to the basic solipsist argument
					2. Anti-civilizationism can cheer civilization's destruction, but once done, they don't have power to stop others from resurrecting it
					3. William James' self fulfilling prophecy - you also state something 'outside' your turf, only to help you later	
		12. These language games are everyday language games
			1. [In ordinary language p doesn't equal ~~p](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-intuitionistic/)
			2. Jain 7 valued logic can be used to model them
		13. Metanarratives will always be many - mononarrative is impossible
			1. Harmony is not where all think the same
				1. That would be only a Nash equiblirium if also powers were equal
			2. Aggregates of individuals cannot e stabilized in a palce on the fitness landscape with the same 'belief' coordinate
			3. All of belief variation should be decomposable into low integer (up to 100) clusters, in the same way personality psychometrics does
				1. They will be definitely correlated
			4. Already Nietzsche said [A moral system valid for all is basically immoral.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche#Misattributed).
			5. Marx did not go for enough with class analysis. Did not know of evolutionary psychology. We know people are tribal and competitive. 
			6. Many moralities are in equilibrium, as are social groups. Ingroup morality is a game theory ruleset, for stabilized groups in Nash equilibrium, governing intra and external affairs. 
			7. In most historical societies there were different rulesets to different people
				1. Mostly differing by the status in resource production, human relations as the mirror of what they create
			8. The metanarrative needs to be subtle, ‘working’ only rarely 
				1. That is to say, that instances when person uses a metanarrative are rare, to minimize collisions when one adheres more strongly. They still have lower - level group interests which might be against the metanarrative (say, guild and official religion).
			9. Metanarrative downplays the role inter-society differences. Tries to be above. 
			10. Then if there is a social gradient in knowledge of the metanarrative, the less empowered will gradually shy away from it. Metanarrative [soothes society differences on the surface.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people) 
			11. Metanarrative wants to be default, unseen, [undefined](https://samharris.org/the-problem-with-atheism/), invisible
			12. Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari, p8-9 - no mononarrative > Unity always operates in an empty dimension supplementary to that of the system considered (overcoding). The point is that a rhizome or multiplicity never allows itself to be overcoded, never has available a supplementary dimension over and above its number of lines, that is, over and above the multiplicity of num-  bers attached to those lines.  
		14. The Ethno-cladistic thesis, if proven, would simplify greatly the discourse about metanarratives
			1. XS, ethno-cladistics > The Ethno-cladistic thesis, sketchily reconstructed here from Mencius Moldbug’s neoreactionary usage, proposes that relations between cultural systems are captured by cladograms to a highly significant level of adequacy
		15. Going back to naming, there is a case for using ' “belief-based community” or “movement”', heralded by [SSC's 2015 post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/25/is-everything-a-religion/) 
		16. Odo Marquard, In Praise of Polytheism > Histories and novels are the— enlightened—polymyths of the modern world.
	5. Language games can be grouped in many ways, the one used here has 4 layers - SPQR. Its purpose is discursive to talk to individual beings analytically and normatively - by code, law or habit.
		1. It is self evident that a need for comparison POV still exists even though point 1.4.10 states that any such POV will not be impartial
			1. Model gains predictive power by clustering possible features into classes
			2. [M. Moldbug 2007](https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/05/six-ways-to-classify-belief-systems/) introduces 5 ways to classify belief systems.
				1. These are
					1. Nominalist - using their name
					2. Typological - a priori, most ML like, but many patterns
					3. Cladistic - pattern of conversion
					4. Morphological - cladistic and typological together
					5. Adaptive - success criterion - not a real classification, seems the difference was to be between state-supported and non-state-supported. But that hinges on the heavy focus on the state, which at this point of the discourse it not yet warranted
				2. Ergo it is reduced to 3 types
					1. Nominalist - the most primitive, too weak explanatory power 
					2. Typological - feature similarity and clustering
					3. Cladistic - needs real world data, with all the pitfalls of using it. Has a limited degree of abstraction
				3. SPQR classification introduced below is of the typological type
		2. There are many systems divinding the language games
			1. Popular ones include dualities of: 'world of experience' and 'world of thought', 'objective' and 'subjective', 'scientific' and 'unscientific', 
			2. This discussion is consistent with epistemological anarchism, where such sharp distinctions are wrong
			3. Each such semi-self-contained linguistic worlds we call from Latin *[mundus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mundus)*, plural *mundi*
				1. Their self sufficiency is from the in-mundi cofrequency being greater than out-mundi - vide 1.5.1
			4. Examination of extant divisions - most of divisions have 2 mundi, some more. 
				1. The drive to monism present in presocratic theories of water, fire and the One, or atoms
				2. Cartesian dualism is the [holotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype) of 2 mundi models
				3. Karl Popper's [3 worlds system from 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popper%27s_three_worlds) lecture goes beyond that, 
					1. The three worlds he presents are:
						1. World 1: the world of physical objects and events, including biological entities 
						2. World 2: the world of mental processes
						3. World 3: objective knowledge
					2. Popper in his lecture concentrates on the 'stacking' of the worlds. He represents that a monist would take everything conceivable as world-1-reducible, analogously dualist reducing to worlds 1 or 2, and that his world 3 makes objective existence of conceptual frameworks and humanity's mind-children - symphonies, planes, etc.
					3. It appears that main motivation was accounting for the third world, and establishing yet another metaphysical system - not a comparison framework.
					4. There are reasons to believe that Chwistek's ‘realities' were more of an analysis of how we use the word 'real' than a new metaphysics.
					5. [Popperian trialism was also embraced by neurophysiologist John Eccles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eccles_(neurophysiologist)#Philosophy) 
				4. [Leon Chwistek's metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Chwistek#Artist) had 4 mundi
					1. Popular reality (common-sense realism)
					2. Physical reality (constructed by physics)
					3. Phenomenal reality (sensory impressions)
					4. Visionary/intuitive reality (dreams, hallucinations, subconscious states).
				5. Ken Wilber's AQAL - [`All quadrants all levels`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)#Theory)
					1. Similar in purpose, yet not abstract enough
					2. The concept of Holons can be borrowed
				6. Advaita Vedanta 3 levels of ontological reality[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism#Three_levels_of_reality) 
					1. > Pāramārthika (paramartha, absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved". This experience can't be sublated (exceeded) by any other experience.
					2. > Vyāvahārika (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya, consisting of the empirical or pragmatic reality. It is ever-changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not metaphysically true. It is "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake". It is the level in which both jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Iswara are true; here, the material world is also true.
					3. > Prāthibhāsika (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone". It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. A well-known example is the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake. 
				7. Most of them have much in common, so analysis must ofcus on controversial places of disagreement
		3. There are requirements for any such systrem
			1. Exhaustiveness
				1. Every concivable entity, idea can be assigned into one of the mundi
				2. E.g. a scientist can say we now *don't know* about some potential particles, but they know that it would be in the mundus of physical reality under the Popperian system
				3. Is a property in degrees in relation to observer's knowledge and imagination, for our most general purposes it's about 
			2. Versatility 
				1. Applicability to any world
				2. A sterile materialistically monist world of pure cosmic dust, with no stable atoms. There would be not subject. Then the description of this world in the Cartesian framework would have 'null' on the 'res cogitans' part.
			3. Neutrality
				1. No ontological pretence
				2. These systems indicate mundi, but we're interested only before they condemn one as illusion - we're interested only instrumentally
				3. This allows for a wide interpretaion of subject-conceptions, no 'self' needs to be posited, even solipsism can be constructed in many of the frameworks
				4. Popper himself in his lecture described himself explicitly as a realist towards all three worlds, so would not approve of this interpretation. 
				5. This reuquirement could be stated as inclusivity towards possibly compatible interpretations
				6. This is by nature limited - no one can escape from some impurities, assumptions from scavenged ideas. 
			4. Resolution
				1. More differences when more categories
			5. Adaptability
				1. Let's suppose a person who speaks of being in close contact with divinity, feeling divinity's ‘invisible hand’ in each act of everyday life, with occasional visions every few weeks. Such a person would be far from accepting Chwistek's division of physical and subconscious reality - for this person everything is mystical. Similarly goes with Popper's division.
			6. Teachability
				1. For metanarratives, their world resolution module (langauge games divisions) needs to be transmissible across time, generations
				2. Can it be derived simply from individual experience? Is priviledged access to some resources needed?
					1. If piece x of the web y in question is only accessible by a dead language acquisition, this cost forms a bottleneck to the number of adherents of the y in the x-complete version
					2. Then y-including-x is different from y-without-x
				3. Popper’s idea is based on very abstract concepts - 'language, work of art, engineering', and grasping their 'family resemblance'. It also uses distinction 'concrete thought process' to 'abstract thought content'.
				4. This is just describing dualism in own words and adding in a maieutic fashion: 'have you thought about that? do symphonies have independent existence?'. There is nothing wrong in this per se, it is just a next layer on a already complex building of philosophy of the topic. The less layers and complexity, the less effort is required, the better.
		4. SPQR also posits 4 mundi, to solve some of the issues with the systems above
			1. The 4 mundi in SPQR are Sophia, the Predictioned, Qualia, and (Ultimate) Reality
				1. Sophia - the mental constructs, e.g. 'res cogitans', mathematics, language, products of imagination, ethics, language games; used to describe the rest. Vide Gadamer's view that language is basic structure to reality, Meinong's jungle, our wording and discussion on further facts, memes. One cannot voluntarily exclude any concept from the S space once it appears there - even if disproven in all others, it remains in S until forgotten
					1. Related discipline - logic.
				2. The Predictioned - everything that we feel that is external to us and influences us - e.g. ‘res extensa’, measurable physical world, what our predictions of qualia come true or false, any behaviours and patterns 'present within us', which at one moment we notice we unconsciously followed, 'collective unconscious', animist interpretations of the natural world, ‘further facts’, hyperreality, hyperstitions. It is named after one of the most popular conceptions of science, that theories are measured by success of their predictions.
					1. Related discipline - philosophy of science, science.
				3. Qualia - Qualia per se, e.g. sensory experience, emotions, thoughts, habits, sense of coherence, sense of causality, sense of self 
					1. Related disciplines - psychology of perception, introspection 
				4. (Ultimate) Reality - answer to the questions: whether we live in a computer simulation, whether solipsism is true, which religion’s Hell exists, question of monism / dualism, animism, a priori analytical statements. Vide Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Zhuangzi's "Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly", René Descartes' scepticism and evil demon, Kant's reflections on the Phenomenon versus the Ding an sich, Robert Nozick's "experience machine", the concept of a simulated reality and the brain in a vat.
					1. Related discipline - mysticism, simulation theory, metaphysics
			2. Graphical representation
				1. We may imagine this as 4 concentric cycles. The innermost is the area of our mental constructs (S). Its perimeter is the border with the ‘outside world’, the border which is our experience (Q). The next ring is the Predicted (P), surrounded by often mysterious Ultimate Reality (R).
				2. This way of representation is built on the idea of individual and internal world and external world - this is from habit and also is probably the most understandable classification - but still the model does it without positing any specific degree reality to the 'sense of self' of the individual.
			3. There are many ways, transformations of other systems and assumptions to arrive at this one. (finite state machine model of meta-ontologies)
				1. Derivations from the 3 systems mentioned above
					1. From Cartesian dualism, 'res cogitans' resembles S, and 'res extensa' P. Q is formed with later additions of Humean and phenomenology. R is added to accout for language games beyond early modern mechanistic understanding of the universe
					2. 3rd world 'objective knowledge' is rejected, the other 2 are split - physical into P and R. 2nd is mainly Q, in a way S covers parts of both 3rd and 2nd
					3. 1(common sense realism) is treated with 2(physical realism) merely as different S theories of P. 3 and 4 are merged into Q, qualia.
				2. From idealism
					1. `Esse est percipi`, so S exists as we perceive it through metacofnition
					2. I have feelings and act on them Q. I think about things without speaking it S. There is some world around me and I am not identical to it P. But sometimes it seems / I reason that there is something beyond this P-world R
				3. From modern scientism
					1. Big Bang started the Universe P inside of some R 11-dimensional multiverse /[insert another unverifiable theory]
					2. Animal emotion was the first Q
					3. Abstract thinking animals using tools use S to reason about P environment
					4. Theory of mind allowed of 'reverse engineering' other specimen's Ss from Qs
					5. Ceremonial funerals pointed out to some R belief
					6. Philosophy started thinking with S about S
				4. A help to think about these can be some analogies
					1. In a discourse, between two humans they have definitely QS internal, PR external. They also can say that P and S are more analyzable, and agreement about them can be reached at least in principle, but differences in Q and R are impenetrable
					2. For a brain in a vat, or sandbox scenario for an AI, or just a convolutional neural network, Q is the input format, S is all the higher level representations that are shuffled around. P is the environment given (can be virtual from 3rd party POV), R is the meta-noumenal - where simulation controllers dwell.
					3. For a child the system could be explained as S- counting in your head, Q - joy, sadness, anger, P - play with others, mastery of the physical, R - questions like where all this comes from
		5. The interactions between the sphere are themselves language games whose native habitat is philosophical discourse. Describing what concepts fall into which interaction (x -> y = x influences y) will expand the definitions of the mundi. 
			1. There are 6 direct interactions ( between neighbours on the list [SPQR]) and 6 indirect ones (where on the graph or list we skip over some). 
				1. Besides the graphical order, direct ones are different in being more mainstream
			2. The direct ones are 
				1. S <- Q
					1. Empiricism - getting ideas from the senses
					2. Homo oeconomicus posits that Q is the input to S as perfect rational engine, decreasing the role of P on S
					3. Problem of induction - creating S generalizations from limited Q samples
					4. Evil demon problem / brain in a vat / political visbility - control over Q influences S
				2. Q <- P
					1. Nature to senses
					2. In solipsism P is equivalent to S
					3. Mary's room in the version 'she learned something new' posits a difference between pure S concept and Q impression
					4. Müller-Lyer illusion - environments prime subjects to fall for the illusion more or less
					5. Organisms can have different *[UmwelteGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt)* even if the same environment
					6. [Umwelt difference is real, all humans don't see blue the same way](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2?r=US&IR=T)
				3. P <- R
					1. Miracles in the non-Humean sense, where we don't redefine Nature to include all novel phenomena
					2. In gnosticism the spiritual good deity beyond the material
					3. Simulation hypothesis
					4. Deja vu in the Matrix movie 
				4. S -> Q
					1. How ideas shape perceptions
					2. Kuhnian 'observations are theory laden'
					3. Brunner & Postman 1949 - black 5 of hearts, red 4 of spades have lower prior to exist, so are not observed
					4. [Kantian schemas are S - Q links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(Kant)#Role_in_Kant's_architectonic_system) 
					5. Also not all observations are fully determined by theory, there is a P limit of how much S can influence Q - [Jerry Fodor's argument bringing up Muller-Lyer illusion as evidence of impenetrability of perceptioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions#Incommensurability_and_perception)
					6. Also phenomenological models only rely on S and Q, treating P instrumentally as a black box
					7. Ernst Mach's phenomenalism, objects as bundles of perceptions
				5. Q -> P
					1. Observer interpretation of QM
					2. We can also consider semi-conscious interactions here, where Q impulse triggers P reaction - reflex actions without thinking
					3. Q - P coupling was closer in the ancestral environment something being Q frightening and P dangerous applies to predators in a forest at night 
						1. Generalized version - P Q are closer in highly optimized aggregates. Then in a way the P-capacity-for-S.
						2. Evolutionarily, bottleneck on Q itself in terms of P success creates S-capacity in P
						3. For any agent there are cybernetic loops of Q output - Q result, through which P is modelled in S. This modelling can be more or less explicit. 
							1. Action-perception condensates. - 1k Plateaus, on Refrain, page 315
						4. When the modelling is embedded, it becomes instinct - such as reflex on touching a hot object, which Q-P-Q (hot-jerk hand back - see my hand is back) is processed without the central nervous system.
						5. This also applies to Heideggerian ['readiness-to-hand'](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/#ModEnc) 
					4. Wittgenstein in Philosophy of Psychology describes this relation as example of 2 language games interacting, reinforcing the main concept behind the SPQR division 
						1. > 34. There is a similarity here to the way in which ‘physical object’ and ‘sense impressions’ stand to each other. We have here two language- games, and their mutual relations are of a complicated kind. —– If one tries to reduce their relations to a simple formula, one goes wrong. |181|
				6. P->R 
					1. Influencing the remote through actions. 
					2. Any ritualistic, physically embedded supplication to deity or force
					3. Strong agnosticism about the ultimate reality regards it as ineffable
			3. The indirect ones are
				1. S -> P
					1. Self fulfilling prophecies, magic
					2. Chinese room experiment is about successful S to P translation
					3. Writing, other type of commiting S into P
				2. S <- P 
					1. We engage directly with P mentally. That is, once we imagine something, we begin to perceive it as something external. The material storage kicks in. How they are stored and influenced by preconceptions, biases and intuitions makes them move against our will, or just unbeknownst. 
					2. Use of scents in marketing
					3. Phineas P. Gage
					4. Physical brain manipulation making subject report stimuli
				3. S -> R
					1. A priori synthetic statements
					2. Theology, theorizing about the ultimate from our reason
				4. S<-R
					1. Divinely inspired art - e.g. Plato's Ion 
					2. Materialist monism likes to delete R at all
				5. Q->R
					1. Superstitions - seeing something causing bad luck
					2. Naive realism - merging the Q with R, with quite thin P layer
					3. Confirmation bias - not treating new sensory data as Bayesian updates to S model, but confirmation of an ultimate R reality model
					4. Q<-R 
						1. Revelations, mysticism
						2. Deism denies this, only sees R -> P ( on creation)
						3. Religious plurality and culture dependent instances of NDEs are arguments against this link - either denying that it's R from which it comes, but rather P (random brain fluctuations), or NDE contents being truly beyond everyday and adaptable to agents. In the latter case NDEs are only a part of R, as the whole R must include not just what they see, but the mechanism determining what do they see
		6. There needs to be more justification of the separation of P and R worlds
			1. Quine said about ontological questions, to be “on a par with questions of natural science” ([1951a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-016-9848-0#ref-CR36 "Quine, W. V. (1951a). On Carnap’s views on ontology. In Quine (1966), pp. 197–202."), 211). Quine as an empirist didn't have to accomodate his model for unfalsifiable entities, or rather unreachable from the holisitic belief web. But here we need to accomodate such positions.
			2. Animists and physicialists both conflate P and R. It's quite ironic, yet psychologically standard. Unknown R is Lovecraftian, there is an urge to purge the unknown.
			3. We can do a further elaboration of the P-R difference by listing examples
				1. P and R cover
					1. R has
						1. Religious unknowns
						2. Simulation hypothesis
						3. Multiverse
						4. Karma systems
					2. P has
						1. Casual unknowns ( will it rain tomorrow?)
						2. Objects like 'chair'
						3. Hyperstitions
						4. Public opinion
						5. Tradition
				2. S model of P and R cover
					1. S models of R include
						1. Personal idea of the Divine
						2. Solution to the hard problem os consciouness
						3. [Acosmism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acosmism) - denial of reality of all but R
						4. [Ietsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ietsism)
					2. S models of P include
						1. Bioenergy healing
						2. Aristotelian science
						3. M theory
						4. Creating hyperstitions
			4. Each web has some Veil - the limit of what of R is expressed in common language of our times. 
		7. Another feature that needs defense is S
			1. Quine criticises the idea of mental ideas, entities - calls it ‘absurd idea’, justifying that it: ‘engenders an illusion of having explained everything’. Our response comes from the practical argument, that it is too popular to be excluded. Frameworks do change beliefs by very observation. The more pressure we put the more exact answers we get, at the price of correctness, i.e. lower chance of identification with the answers. Beliefs are quantum states.
				1. Quotes from WVO Quine, from a logical point of vie, 1953, page 48
			2. We can posit 'thin S', which is equivalent to our working memory. Once we say something, commit to writing or memory it isn't pure S, but S-embedded-in-P, and the read operation on that comes with its own pitfalls. S holding only 7 objects is much more Outside dependent than the Cartesian thick S
			3. Argument for thin S is from obstinacy of S objects to be moulded to will - 
				1. Mathematical possibilities for instance
					1. Wittgenstein, PI mentions restrictions on the domain of the imaginable > 517. The question arises: Can’t we be mistaken in thinking that we understand a question? For some mathematical proofs do lead us to say that we cannot imagine something which we believed we could imagine. (For example, the construction of a heptagon.) They lead us to revise what counts as the domain of the imaginable.
				2. Wittgenstein's Tractatus was a demarcation of S
			4. We could also say we experience S via Q only, not directly. 
			5. Interesting side effect of positing that we experience(Q) S through P is such a respositioning of the circle diagram that S is right beside R. That is quite a Platonist direction
			6. Q can be more immediate than S as that's the reptilian vs mammalian brain P-distinction
			7. There are quite many precents for treating S world as existing
				1. Stirner, 'ego and its own' page 198 >‘Nothing at all is justified by being. What is thought of is as well as what is not thought of; the stone in the street is, and my notion of it is too. Both are only in different spaces, the former in airy space, the latter in my head, in me; for I am space like the street.’ 
				2. Wittgenstein, PI > 518. Socrates to Theaetetus: “And if someone imagines, mustn’t he imagine something?” a Th.: “Yes, he must.” a Soc.: “And if he imagines something, mustn’t it be something real?” a Th.: “Apparently.” And mustn’t someone who is painting be painting something and someone who is painting something be painting something real? i
			8. The S world is under most theories capable of reaching 'end of science'. There's a couple of considerations here.
				1. We can take this Quine quote as the starting point: > what if… we have achieved a theory that is conformable to every possible observation, past and future? In what sense could the world then be said to deviate from what the theory claims? _Clearly in none_…. (Quine 1981, 22; emphasis added)
				2. Would the end of science be recognizable? Would it be predictable? Asymptotic or sudden and final limit?
				3. What facts are on the table?
					1. Underdetermination of science tells us that many S theories can fit P explanations and R ( unknown ) discourse predictions
					2. The extent of how much into the immediate R we can reach is determined contingently by our civilization capacity in energy and power, e.g. reviewing systems, incentives alignment, accelerator power increases
					3. As we see more nad more of the things the world will ever show us, the things we will never see come to dominate our predictions
					4. [Peircian long run approximation science pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_theories_of_truth#Pragmatic_views) assumes idealized cilivizational epistemic mechanism which is not the case. Such an approximation would be fine in the case of thin R, where we're already at 95% of possible knowledge and assume the long term is not far off.
				4. Therefore we are in P space of possibility, our civilization can stumble upon possible R statements with higher beam energies, creating heavier and heavier elements. Yet that need not happen. There is no guarantee our civilization can see the R set in this way, no ergodicity guarantee. It sounds like a good bet to increase the likelihood of ergodic walks, key to that is de-ideologization and decentralization
				5. Maybe some scientific laws are only discoeverable by civilizations earlier than us. Or later. Maybe there are things so rare that they are now too scare, but once they are more commonplace complex life has had its run
		8. The test for SPQR success is its applicability to translate philosophical problems into mundi interactions. Some examples are provided here:
			1. Note: OIC stands for 'object / idea / concept', ScX where X is of the set SPQR, means 'S conception of X'
			2. Pairs of disagreeing concepts and SPQR illustration
				1. Atheism - deism - in the first one 'God' figures only in QPR, in the second only in the past R as engaging with P
				2. Material monism - mental monism - the first one reduces R to P, the second R to S/Q, denying P
				3. Material monism - Cartesian dualism - material reduces R to P, Cartesian dualism recognizes both P (res extensa) and SQR (res cogitans)
				4. Quantum view of consciousness - anatta - the 'self' is in SQPR in the first one, only in SQ in the second
				5. Materialistic monism - simulation hypothesis - in 1 everything is reduced to P, in 2 S and Q may operate on different R-code than P 
				6. Creationism - evolutionism - both are ScP, 1 is R-inseparable, 2 is consistent with materialist monism 
				7. Agnosticism - theism - both are ScR, 1 denies possibility of S knowledge of OIC 'God' R existence, second admits it 
				8. Theological noncognitivism - theism - 1 denies OIC 'God' S property 'coherence', while 2 grants it
				9. Body identity - memory identity - these are Sc of identity, 1 recognizes ScP coherence as S identity criterium, 2 takes S constructions of Q memory
				10. Revelation - reason - 1 claims direct S and Q <-R relation, while the second denies that, emphasises Sc of P 
				11. Essentialism - social constructivism - 1 claims P (genetic) or R (soul) origin of object characteristics, 2 P inter SQ relations 
				12. Conservatism - revolutionism - these are Sc of constructing ScP; 1 claims that Q data and S analysis of P is insufficient for radical Q-P action, while 2 claims that sufficient adding Sc-inter-Q claims of injustice, making radical QP action a prescription
			3. Singular ones
				1. Kantian phenomena - noumena distinction - reduces SPQR to Q and R
				2. Advaia Vedanta 3 levels have the following correspondences to SQPR 
					1. Paramartha - R
					2. Vyavahara - P
					3. Pratibhasika - Q and S
				3. Hume»s fork - necessary' as S construct of R, contingent as QP dependent
				4. Occam's razor - minimizing the number of S constructs as a criterion for choosing S systems of belief / comparing S hypotheses
				5. Deontologist ethics - Sc QP action of ScR origin
				6. Utilitarian ethics - Sc QP action in terms of S maximising interPQ variable
				7. Descriptive evolutionary ethics - Sc interPQrelations as origin of Q moral sensitivities and S ethical constructs
				8. Normative evolutionary ethics- S attempt to derive S rules for interPQ behaviour from descriptive variant
				9. Virtue ethics - Sc of PQ behaviour interpreted in light of QS feedback loop
				10. Swamp man - S riddle of Sc identity in relation to P determination
				11. Theseus ship - whether S identity is changed after PQ change of S parts with staying S pattern 
				12. Chinese room - whether P agent has S knowledge and Q agency upon P successful management of S type tasks
				13. Tortoise and Achilles - shows incommensurate ness of a type of S reasoning upon a PQ system
				14. Religious plurality - challenge to S religions - PQ observed plurality of R claims how accommodated in S system
				15. Problem of evil - problem of PQ presence of S OIC 'evil' in light of ScR
				16. Problem of religious language - problem of ScR; concerning that most often S is used to PQ cases
				17. Trolley problem - vide utilitarian ethics
				18. Miracles - novel PQ occurrences which from hereto have been forbidden from ScP, interpreted by ScR
				19. Future contingents - problem of applicability of S OIC 'bivalence principle' in respect to PQ interactions of OICs 'ships' in S domain OIC 'future'
				20. Inverted spectrum - experiment what would mean if Q and S descriptions of Q changed with P staying constant 
				21. Underdetermination - OIC that ScP are limited by PQ observation results that many S construct would fill the S criterium 'sufficient cause' for OIC of given PQ occurrence
				22. Morning Star and Evening Star - a posteriori necessity - coming to S conclusion that two signifiers for P objects have the some S common signified
				23. 1966 "The sheep in the field", Roderick Chisholm - vide Gettier problem - koan of one hand clapping and falling tree - riddles concerning finding S hidden presumptions about nature of Q impressions and P interaction; that clapping involves P interaction and sound as either P noumenon or Q phenomenon
					1. (Alice and the clock example) - ScP formed from Q view of the clock coupled with S presumptions of P functioning of OIC 'clocks'
				24. Political not metaphysical' agreement - agreement on P actions, not S or Q or R basis
				25. Theory of meaning - S entities pointing to other S objects
				26. Theory of reference - S entities pointing to ~S objects
				27. Map and territory (Korzybski) - S entities describing P entities, the saying itself points to the difference between S and P
				28. Set of all sets that do not contain themselves (Russell's paradox), ‘Meinong’s jungle’, ‘married bachelor’ - S conjecture, when begun in a small web of statements it might not show contradiction, when the web increases to contain certain implications a contradiction appears. 
				29. Analytic - synthetic distinction - assuming it exists, analytic is just internal S, synthetic S based on Q.
				30. Time - Time as S conception is time as word, as a concept, as Q feeling of passage of time, as our P predicts and our feeling that R exists.
				31. World as forum for action - JB Peterson 1999 - is about mapping SQP action-perception condensates into a compressed form closer to QP, reducing S overhead, which is the main bottleneck for life. 
					1. See ibid p14 for how the forum for action is composed
					2. See ibid p66 for how a story as compression interacts with the brain
		9. Translating another concept or idea into the belief systems
			1. The simplest way is to
				1. List relevant conepts to a given worldview
				2. Categorize into different 4 boxes
				3. Outlines what interactions are allowed
				4. Even individual claims may be positioned within this sphere, not only whole metanarratives
					1. For example Hume’s argument against the self in the Treatise on Human Nature may be represented as deleting the entity ‘self’ from R, while it remains in Q and S and is constituted by Q ('bundles of sensations').
				5. Mark barriers between mundi as thick or blurry dependin on if communications between them are allowed
			2. Graphically the results could look like
				1. In Solipsism R - S as bidirectional, P only proceeding from S, Q used only to indicate which parts of themselves they consider to be latent in P and which directly controlled
				2. Christian mysticism
					1. From R to S God-inspired thoughts and writings
					2. From P to Q God manifested in world's beauty
					3. From R to P creation continuo
					4. From R to Q mystic vision
				3. Material monism - P merged with R, all speaking to S through Q
				4. Cartesian dualism
					1. Res cogitans in S and R 
					2. P as res extensa
					3. Cogito ergo sum arrow on S - synthetic a priori
					4. Pineal gland between Q and P
					5. From S proof of R - God
		10. The purpose of SPQR is to be helpful in respectful discourse between people in disagreement. The basic income hoped for is passing the ideological Turing test. The better income hoped for is realization of some deep source of the difference. 
			1. The result is peace and clarity, as mutual belief understanding either
				1. Removes motivation for conflict 
				2. Strengthens motivation for conflict, yet makes it more localized, about specific issues.
			2. Localized conlict about specific issues is much more abenable to diplomatic solutions AND precludes demonization of the adversary
	6. Invidiuals in society are nodes for the metanetwork of all the metanarratives. Wittgensteinian *[Lebensform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_life_(philosophy))* similar to soul and Jungian archetype
		1. Lebensform is a set of all behaviours and explicit and implicit statements / assumptions that is more fine-grained than metanarrative.
			1. The example from 5.1.2.2 (monk vs farmer, both Christians) presents two Lebensformen under the same metanarrative
				1. More eaxmples of archetypes are Chinese [5 social bonds.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40725916?seq=1)
				2. [Brand archetypes](https://iconicfox.com.au/brand-archetypes/), whether they work or not
				3. Tarot archetypes
				4. Pascal in Pensées on page 251 says that Lebensformen need accounting for in metanarratives 
					1. > Other religions, as the pagan, are more popular, for they consist in externals. But they are not for educated people. A purely intellectual religion would be more suited to the learned, but it would be of no use to the common people. The Christian religion alone is adapted to all, being composed of externals and internals. It raises the common people to the internal, and humbles the proud to the external; it is not perfect without the two, for the people must understand the spirit of the letter, and the learned must submit their spirit to the letter.
			2. Lebensform is represented in the acts of the agents, including speech
			3. Each person / assemblage can have
				1. Behaviour, including economical relations
				2. Explicit beliefs and assumptions - mentioned in the questionnaire
				3. Implicit beliefs and assumptions - Markov hidden state
			4. These can be assigned to Johari windows, with 1 in 'arena' and 'blind spot', 2 in arena, 3 in the unknown
			5. In a way 2 is a subset of 1, but it deals with the Webs, so we have privildged access to it as opposed to other parts of 1
			6. Web of bleiefs could be grouped according to a relevance to a given Lebensform - 
				1. Key ones, changechange of which would necessitate a major lifestyle change, 
				2. And on the second end of the spectrum, those which are not verifiable according to a given Lebensform, e.g. the number of people within the borders of Athens at noon on the first day of 399 BCE.
			7. Most if not all of the variation in Lebensformen is from reproductive status (filiation) and social capital, hence varying mainly with age and [gender](https://web.archive.org/web/20161106215557/http://www.ufblog.net/sexual-politics/)
			8. [All think of status before changing open beliefs](https://quillette.com/2021/04/03/persuasion-and-the-prestige-paradox-are-high-status-people-more-likely-to-lie/).

		2. Properties
			1. It is imposed all around
			2. It persists after death
				1. That is not willed, often dead relatives are more of a problem than it's worth
				2. Hell is real
				3. Yourt tulpa joins your ancestors in their body-without-organs
					1. @Moopdrepa on twitter [> Thinking back on this quote from Jim Davis where he essentially says that Garfield is a tulpa](https://twitter.com/moopdrea/status/1257691672076566529)
				4. Warm, and even cold body is treated in a specified way. There are expected interactions. Later they assume roles of people to whom promises are to be filled, also respected ancestors. See the pictures of past bloodlines in old castles, etc. Their beliefs are also malpresented, and transfer of beliefs from them still happens (at least since invention of writing). That is further expanded when we do talk about ancestry worship, deification, etc.

				5. Feynman wrote a [letter](https://fs.blog/richard-feynman-love-letter/) to his wife 16 months after her death > I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real. 
				6. > The greater the phenomenal appropriateness with which we take the no-longer-Dasein of the deceased, the more plainly is it shown that in such Being-with the dead, the authentic Being-come-to-an-end of the deceased is precisely the sort of thing which we do _not_ experience. Death does indeed reveal itself as a loss, but a loss such as is experienced by those who remain. In suffering this loss, however, we have no way of access to the loss-of-Being as such which the dying man ‘suffers’. The dying of Others is not something which we experience in a genuine sense; at most we are always just ‘there alongside’. (_Being and Time_ 47: 282)

			6. Lebensformen are like [characters in a play](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AqbWna2S85pFTsHH4/the-intelligent-social-web#:~:text=know%20they%E2%80%99re%20confused.-,I%20claim%20that%20most%20of%20us%2C%20most%20of%20the%20time%2C%20are%20playing%20out%20characters%20as%20defined%20by%20the%20surrounding%20web%20%E2%80%94%20and%20we%20usually%20haven%E2%80%99t%20a%20clue%20how%20to%20Look%20at%20this%20fact%2C%20much%20less%20intentionally%20use%20our%20web%20slack%20to%20change%20our%20stories.,-I%20think%20this)
			7. Marriage can really merge two Lebensformen into one in a sense
			8. It cannot be fully ascriptive
			9. It is hard to change on individual level, ambition is the main way it occurs in a planned manner
			10. There is always cognitive conservatism, with some variance in the function of openness to experience
			11. Their transmission isn't *pure*, so to some extent they need to be discovered in each generation [real life TarzaGnon(https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/real-life-tarzan-man-who-lived-41-years-inside-jungle-didnt-know-about-women-and-sex-3897227.html) 
			12. No Lebensform is has intristically higher fulfillment ceiling than other through hedonic treadmill, yet they have different floors
				1. Different Lebensformen give similar, humanly maximal satisfaction in their best moments
				2. What counts is the frequency of the thought that somebody with different Lebensformen lives better, moments of jealousy. 
			13. You can go 'easy and lazy' mode in any of them, 
			14. The most basic Lebensforms are DNA hardcoded, the more you diverge from nascent and ancestral-like-environment, the more queer Lebensforms will be the product
			15. Not only is the Lebensform an emergent property of the body, but it also reterritorializes on it. Lebensform status is inscribed on the body, be it through tatoos, jewelry, or other fashion (e.g. [safety piGnon(https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/9432/the-ten-most-iconic-safety-pin-moments-in-fashion))
			16. Tulpas are path - based. Tulpas live on human memory and that record of a person at time 1 is merged with person at time 2. That looks like a necessary asumption, but has some side effects.
				1. This causes an intutiion to reject 'only current state' arguments
				2. Traitors are suspicious also to their new friends
				3. Different behaviour based on path is examplified in the nouveaux riches phenomenon
				4. Changing side is an indicator of a difference from both sides.
				5. That makes you different to new friends and past group alike, your actions and tulpa can't be modelled as easily - it's harder to trust you
				6. This model gives reasons (not justifications) to naive *othering* of those who change allegiances, most prominently immigrants / emigrants and transgender people.
		3. Doxastic reductionism hypothesis - only the way of life matters
			1. We can reduce all belief distinctions into *Lebensform* distinctions 
			2. In other words, there are no two people who have the same beliefs yet differnet *Lebensform* coordinates
			3. Extant beliefs map non-injectively and surjectively into the set of *Lebenforms*
			4. A further hypothesis is that: 'the more socially different people are, the more different are their belief webs'
			5. It is expected that the three sets of coordinates - metanarrative, Lebensform and belief webs, are not orthogonal and are heavily correlated
			6. If ‘beliefs’ turn out not to change anything, that confirms [base and superstructure theory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_and_superstructure)
			7. This hypothesis also relates the [conscious evolutioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscious_evolution) hypothesis - if we can navigate
		4. Interaction with metanarratives
			1. Lebensforms and metanarratives attract each other by seeking similarities
			2. There can be more metanarratives (non-optimized memeplexes) than Lebensforms (contingent on human biology)
			3. An important parameter of a society is the number of Lebensformen and number of metanarratives
			4. There is limited number of people of each Lebensform in each metanarrative 
				1. In the simplest case leader-follower there's an equilibrium 
					1. Too many leaders -> breakoff
					2. Too many followers -> expansion to other territories
				2. Barriers to entry and exist are another crucial equilibria here
			5. The case when nLebensformen = nMetanarratives is a rare, no-reason-to-be-stable-case, so we just need to consider two cases.
			6. By pidgeonholding principle if there are more
				1. Lebensformen, metanarratives become 'broad tent'. 
					1. That happens in a city with different guilds that needs to defend itself
					2. Camps structure along lines of Lebensform clusters. 
					3. Traditional societies maintained inter-professional cohesion by trust in egalitarianism of death
				2. Metanarratives - they quickly fracture over the smallest differences
					1. Highly catabolic
					2. Attrition on all sides might lead to atomization and disaffection
					3. Tolerance between different Lebensformen even within the same metanarrative is lower
			7. Change in metanarrative must be preceded by change in Lebensform
				1. Only it provides enough of psychological force, see this [case story](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AqbWna2S85pFTsHH4/the-intelligent-social-web#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20watched%20religious,moved%20to%20Utah.)
				2. On Lebensform change social capital is lowered
					1. No on e likes the kid who changed schools
				3. New Lebensform changes the territory you're operating in, you have less investment available in other metanarratives, can switch to a new one with low cost
				4. These might apply to various circumstances, such as religious conversion(?not Paul, maybe Darwin?), coming out about sexuality, changing friends circles, ‘from rags to riches’ stories.
			8. Lebensformen have variants of a given metanarrative, variants which are *different*, yet retain some family resemblance
			9. Each metanarrative can only support so many Lebensformen without 'salt losing its flavour'
		5. Differences in Lebensformen are not purely memetic, but also epigenetic
			1. Discipline & Punish p. 253 > The delinquent, the strange manifestation of an overall phenomenon of criminality, is to be found in quasi-natural classes, each endowed with its own characteristics and requiring a specific treatment, what Marquet-Wasselot called in r84r the'ethnography of the prisons'; 'The convicts are . .. another people within the  same people; with its own habits, instincts, morals' (Marquet-  Wasselot, p). We are still very close here to the 'picturesque' descriptions of the world of the malefactors - an old tradition that  goes back a long way and gained new vigour in the early nineteenth  century, at a time when the perception of another form of life was  being articulated upon that of another class and another human  species. A zoology of social sub-species and an ethnology of the  civilizations of malefactors, with their own rites and language, was  beginning to emerge in a parody form.’

			7. In all societies where the phenomenon of third gender persons occured, they were always correlated with economic division of labour. They played specific roles in their communities; i.e. change in sex / gender was not ceteris paribus in relation to occupation and social role in wider understanding. Vide example of ancient Israel, closely tied to reproductive role (the social shaming of barren women) [see more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender#History)
			8. If there is any specialization we shouldn't expect complete division, as per Ricardian international markets principle
			9. Ant queen is the gonads, each ant is an organ - all prescribed role, all from the same DNA
				1. W D Hamilton 1964 Inclusive Fitness
			10. Sexual roles are of the same distinction as economical roles in the animal world; reproductive status, so the difference between ‘beta male’ and ‘alpha male’, or different soldier and worker ants are the same as from the queen
			11. Incel and alpha male are two different genders, Lebensformen
			12. 'Gender' is an inferior catogory, less fine grained than Lebensform
			13. Social mobility will be always as Chads have illegitimate children - brood parasitism
			14. In theory two genders could have vastly different active genomes and still interlock. Static all life guardian of eggs and active seeker of resources.
		6. One of the most important things is the power law and inequality in influence
			1. Fromm, Escape from Freedom, page 98 > “ In any society the spirit of the whole culture is determined by the spirit of those groups that are most powerful in that society. This is so partly because these groups have the power to control the educational system, schools, church, press, theatre, and thereby to imbue the whole population with their own ideas; furthermore, these powerful groups carry so much prestige that the lower classes are more than ready to accept and imitate their values and to identify themselves psychologically. “ 
	7. Spirit is the animating principle 
		1. Ergo it's an animistic universe, everything that moves has a spirit, way of life
		2. That is more than hylozoic universe, vide Jungian pleroma
		3. Spirit as animating principle has two forms 
		4. The Outside one, unknowable, always mutating. The second form is tulpa - how it is viewed by other nodes.

			2. WVO Quine, from a logical point of vie, 1953, page 44 > ‘[But] in point of epistemological footing the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entries enter our conception only as cultural points.’
			3. Bodies which speak of plurality of mind inside them are an example of a host to mulitple tulpas. See [morethanone website](https://morethanone.info/#myths), some [more links on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/comments/ef8006/places_and_resources_to_explore/) 
			4. Tulpa = program = law
				1. Personal God is as real as you are
				2. Anatta = atheos
				3. That is, whether you attribute tulpahood to an assemblage is arbitrary
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 56 > We may even say that the abstract machines that emit and combine particles have two very different modes of existence: the Ecumenon and the Planomenon. Either the abstract machines remain prisoner to stratifications, are enveloped in a certain specific stratum whose program or unity of composition they define (the abstract Animal, the abstract chemical Body, Energy in itself) and whose movements of relative deterritorialization they regulate, Or, on the contrary, the abstract machine cuts across all stratifications, develops alone and in its own right on the plane of consistency whose diagram it constitutes, the same machine atwork in astrophysics and in microphysics, in the natural and in the artifi-cial, piloting flows of absolute deterritorialization (in no sense, of course, is unformed matter chaos of any kind). But this presentation is still too simplified.
					2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 266 >Then there is an altogether different plane, or an altogether different conception of the plane. Here, there are no longer any forms or develop- ments of forms; nor are there subjects or the formation of subjects. There is no structure, any more than there is genesis. There are only relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness between unformed elements, or at least between elements that are relatively unformed, molecules and particles of all kinds. There are only haecceities, affects, subjectless individuations that constitute collective assemblages. Nothing develops, but things arrive late or early, and form this or that assemblage depending on their compositions of speed. Nothing subjectifies, but haecceities form according to compositions of nonsubjectified powers or affects. We call this plane, which knows only longitudes and latitudes, speeds and haecceities, the plane of consistency or composition (as opposed to the plan(e) of organization or development). It is necessarily a plane of immanence and univocality. We therefore call it the plane of Nature, although nature has nothing to do with it, since on this plane there is no distinction between the natural and the artificial.
				4. Selfhood is almost infinitely malleable
					1. > But the effects of imagination, or images originating in the mental disposition, may be omens of some future event; inasmuch as the mind may have a confused presentiment of the future. It may, therefore, imagine a future event as forcibly and vividly, as though it were present; for instance a father (to take an example resembling your own) loves his child so much, that he and the beloved child are, as it were, one and the same. And since (like that which I demonstrated on another occasion) there must necessarily exist in thought the idea of the essence of the child's states and their results, and since the father, through his union with his child, is a part of the said child, the soul of the father must necessarily participate in the ideal essence of the child and his states, and in their results, as I have shown at greater length elsewhere.

					3. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari,1k Plateaus >In the course of a single day, an individual repeatedly passes from language to language. He successively speaks as "father to son" and as a boss; to his lover, he speaks an infantilized language; while sleeping he is plunged into an oniric discourse, then abruptly returns to a professional language when the tele- phone rings. It will be objected that these variations are extrinsic, that it is still the same language.
				5. Malleability and dependence on the material create the moral luck problem for the concept of immortal soul in hypotheticals
					1. JBPeterson, Maps of Meaning, 1999, page 246 > “Our tyrannical tendencies and moral decadences generally find their expression limited by our narrow domains of personal power. We cannot doom millions to death, at a whim, because we do not have the resources to do so. We satisfy ourselves, in the absence of such power, with riding roughshod over those near to us – and congratulate ourselves on our moral virtue. We use aggression and strength to bend dependent others to our will – or, in the absence of strength, use sickness and weakness to harness the force of empathy, and deceive our way to dominance, underground. Granted the opportunity, how many of us would not be Hitlers? Assuming we had the ambition, dedication and power of organization – which is highly unlikely. Paucity of skill, however, does not constitute moral virtue.”
				6. Self is exported from oneself with age, it trickles down into objects that labour has been invested into
					1. Pascal's Pensées, paragraph 147 - > We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves and in our own being; we desire to live an imaginary life in the mind of others, and for this purpose we endeavour to shine. We labour unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary existence, and neglect the real. And if we possess calmness, or generosity, or truthfulness, we are eager to make it known, so as to attach these virtues to that imaginary existence. We would rather separate them from ourselves to join them to it; and we would willingly be cowards in order to acquire the reputation of being brave. A great proof of the nothingness of our being, not to be satisfied with the one without the other, and to renounce the one for the other! For he would be infamous who would not die to preserve his honour.

				1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 479 > A Body without Organs instead of an organism and organization. Perception in it is based on symptoms and evaluations rather than measures and properties. That is why smooth space is occupied by intensities, wind and noise, forces, and sonorous and tactile qualities, as in the desert, steppe, or ice. The creaking of ice and the song of the sands. Striated space, on the contrary, is canopied by the sky as measure and by the measurable visual qualities deriving from it.

					1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 351 >Lawrence attacks the poverty of the immutable identical images, the figurative roles that are so many tourniquets cutting off the flows of sexuality: "fiancee, mistress, wife, mother"—one could just as easily add "homosexuals, heterosexuals," etc.—all these roles are distributed by the Oedipal triangle, father-mother-me, a representative ego thought to be defined in terms of the father-mother representations, by fixation, regression, assumption,  sublimation—and all of that according to what rule?
					2. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 352 > With the result that schizoanalysis would come to nothing if it did not add to its positive tasks the constant destructive task of disintegrating the normal ego. Lawrence, Miller, and then Laing were able to demonstrate this in a profound way: it is certain that neither men nor women are clearly defined personalities, but rather  vibrations, flows, schizzes, and "knots." The ego refers to personological co-ordinates from which it results, persons in their turn refer to familial co-ordinates, and we shall see what the familial constellation refers to in order to  produce individuals in its turn

That is the interaction between Johari windows 'you know, they don't' and 'you both know', what 'only they know' is trivially the human - perceptible manifestation of your Spirit (equally as your body temperature is robot-with-body-heat-camera-perceptible manifestation of it).

			2. By manipulating your hormones you're basically doing hauntology
		8. Complexity of tulpas is dependent on the computing Spirit, its substrate and size.
			1. Supercomputer can model rats better than a cat does.
			2. That is analogous to the Viterbi path search
		9. From ./5 (idemlevel point no 5) follows are tulpas are finite
		10. [[we are bundles of sensations]], assemblages of Chi in Spirit
			1. Any choice to make tulpification out of these is aribitrary - vide 5 assemblages discourse - that is *anatta*
			2. These sensations repeat throughout the universes.
			3. You do not exist, yet you are present in infinite universes. You contain multitudes, yet multitudes also contain you. As Borges said, when reading Hamlet, every person is in some way Shakespeare.	
			4. [[we are the universe experiencing itself]]
				1. As per ~/1 ( rejection of solipsism), we see the sensations as phenomenons of the Outside
				2. Any set of experienced sensations can be exhaustively broken down into a number of tulpas - that is how polytheism is possible	
		11. The system of Human Spirit - the assemblage of all of Humanity is finite.
			1. As its sub-Spirits ( Human Spirits) are finite too, the walk is of the Human Spirit in the space of the human souls is ergodic - that is the transmigration of souls
		12. There is a feedback loop between metanarratives and the society. There must be. [Nothing new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory#Herbert_Spencer's_Criticism).
			1. They shape each other like [tetris](https://en.wi	kipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) - not tower, but lake - ppl are malleable blocks which change to fit a space in a drifting raft. Together the small elements form ‘spaceships’, as in [Conway’s game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Each element as person (4 blocks) gets more and more rigid with the years. 
			2. We can describe these relations only in one direction, (from society to people )using tools already described here. We discussed what are the elements of metanarratives, structure and their evolution. Then belief groups as elements in society. Now it is time for structure.
			3. Metanarratives are tied to power, no free playing field for metanarratives
				1. Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari, 351 > Georges Dumezil, in his definitive analyses of Indo-European mythology, has shown that political sovereignty, or domination, has two heads: the magician-king and the jurist-priest. Rex and flamen, raj and Brahman, Romulus and Numa, Varuna and Mitra, the despot and the legislator, the binder and the organizer. 
		13. There can occur [coupling between webs](https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1370163894459760647)
2. Universe is particular
	1. Universe constantly mutates, tries something new. It's a computer program always underway. To see if it terminates it's impossible. (stopping problem). There is no [Heimarmene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimarmene).
	2. Universe is limited
		1. We can have no scientific method ( induction, experiements), regarding large scale formations - such as capitalism. Whatever is said about these is more of a hyperstition, trend extrapolation 
		2. The more primitive outcomes, the less statistics we can do on them, less objectively emergent qualities. so the self-indication argument (anthropic principle) is correct against self-sampling (the idea of being random). that we are were we are from that universe
	3. You can zoom out of the universe
		1. Imagine a zoomed - out universe. You'd probably say that there's nothing, then something, then maybe nothing again. 010. That's one of the lowest spatio-temporal resolutions you might have. If you decrease temporal resolution even more, you get just 1. That's the Parmenidesian One. 
		2. Now imagine the highest spatio-temporal resolution. Under atomistic materialistic quantum loop theory it's Plank length 3 space timensions, and similarly short time dimension. In string theory there's more dimensions. Physicists got a couple of cool things going on in this regard, Holographic Principle for instance.
		3. These are the 2 most disparate models, maps of the territory. Practical considerations, observer effects limit resolution. Pragmatically for us subatomic lengths seem the lower bound for some time.
	4. First cycles *Oceans* - There are patterns in the Universe
		1. If you made it as a [[SimulatioGnon], you might have loads of 0s and 1s running around. Now how detailed do you choose your resolution? How much resolution is visible to the emergent agents in that realm? 
		2. You're going to have some patterns in your simulation. It's unavoidable. These constitute [assemblages]. In some universes there are some are self-replicating ones. 
		3. Let's say there's just a couple of starting laws( [li]), and you put some small scale embodiment ([chi]) of these patterns together. Big Bang. From that instance, you can go deterministically, or introduce some randomness. That distinction is relatively unimportant. In either case, produced assemblages will have a host of emergent properties. Plateaus of development - quasi-stable patterns that they embody. The maximum amount of complexity - the highest plateau possible - is a function of these laws and the amount of energy given them. 
		5. Our universe seems to have a shelf life. Chance at complexity to arise is in some period of time. Window for it to maintain itself is much longer. [link to Isaac Arthur ]. It's still quite [young](https://www.xenosystems.net/cosmological-infancy/). 
			1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 508 > What is retained and preserved, therefore created, what consists, is only that which increases the number of connections at each level of division or composition, thus in descending as well as ascending order (that which is cannot be divided without changing in nature, or enter into a larger composition without requiring a new criterion of comparison...). 
		6. There are different sizes of assemblages. And different lifespans. A smaller assemblage can outlive a bigger one, but also vice versa. These relationships, constant changes below it and above it, form the reaction to oceans. From a more temporal point of view, they are [[Cycles]]. Yet there is also the Unchangeable Gnon. It is the environment that assemblages operate in, through the more mystical instinctive Spirituality and pragmatic reason Navigation.
			1. [Original cult of Gnon article](https://web.archive.org/web/20130609065403/http://www.xenosystems.net/the-cult-of-Gnon/) 
		7. There is a cap on efficiency of any assemblage, any ocean. The best solution S to any problem is only a heuristic that succeeds in a given % of cases.
			1. Your local view might present itself in a sample that S is not the most efficient. Then there occurs a tradeoff of local efficiency and adhering to the Way - Spirit S.
		8. Cycles can be divided by
			1. Length
			2. Scale / plane of action
			3. Self-referentiality
				1. Hegel = his thought as culmination of self-recognition of Spirit
				2. Theosophy = as important synthesis of various traditions
				3. Marx = essentially refers to itself as cycle - breaking
				4. Cliodynamics = he [says](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamics/) that awareness of the process helps. Tbh if it does not it just makes us tragic protagonists.
			4. Finitude (whether repeating this given cycle involves a non-repeating movement on some other dimension)
				1. In Marx, capitalistic cycles are utlimately ending up in static non-cyclincal socialism
			5. Factors that make the cycle
				1. Decay of information
					1. Theosophy
					2. Buddhist Three Ages
				2. Human psychology and economic costs
					1. Kuhnian science cycles, every funeral etc
					2. Asabbiyah and loss of cohesion
				3. Some [argue against](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2017/02/historical-cycle-theories-are-sillyor.html) strict time bound periodicity. Against the more spiritual ‘exact years must pass approach’, more popular might be notion that determined are some conditions for, say, tension, but when they are release is dependent on [unpredictable events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand), say [black / white swans.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) 
			6. Connection to the linear conception of time
				1. Can be pro-cyclical, accelerationist
				2. Anti-cyclical
					1. Aristotle
					2. Republican tradition
				3. Syn-cyclical - just embracing the cycle
					1. Camus and the cycle of warrior's conquests, actor's characters and seducer's conquests
				4. Cycle - breaking (very often similar to pro-cyclical)
					1. Marx
					2. Land
			7. Inevitability - characteristic of those cycle-breaking
			8. Our current location 
				1. [Some see](https://www.academia.edu/36810724/The_21st_Century_Singularity_and_its_Big_History_Implications_A_re-analysis) acceleration as leading to inflection point, with a slowdown later.
		9. A person can strongly, affectively hold a belief about cyclicality at some period length, while rejecting it at another, even to believe in linearity at some different level as equally important.
		10. Cycles by length, from longest to shortest 
			1. Total
				1. Nietzsche - eternal return
				2. Often more than million years - Hindu [Kalpas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_(aeon)#Hinduism)

				3. Rene Guenon - Kali Yuga ( tl;dr second hand [commentary](https://orthosphere.wordpress.com/2018/05/16/the-kali-yuga-rene-guenons-traditionalist-critique-of-quantitative-modernity/), [original](https://books.google.pl/books?id=IqybJkbPgBUC&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) , also see [here](https://sufipathoflove.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/1970-traditional-forms-and-cosmic-cycles.pdf))
				4. Several centuries - Chinese phases of yin and yang, manifested at all levels tbh, here Mandate of Heaven most relevant, [interpreted in even more ways](http://www.chinastrategies.com/historical-cycles-are-we-doomed-to-repeat-the-past
				5. [Historic recurrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_recurrence
				6. [Aristotle's Kyklos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyklos) an [Polybius's Anacyclosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacyclosis) - pipeline of anti-cyclic thought - Ibn Khaldun [asabiyyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqaddimah#%CA%BFAsabiyyah)
				2. Hegel - dialectic cycle (accompanied by realization of Spirit)
				2. Marxist class warfare epochs
				3. O. Spengler - [‘Decline of the West’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_the_West)
			3. 50-200 years
				1. John Glubb - ‘Fate of empires’([tl;dr](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/47tif6/fate_of_empires/), [long](http://people.uncw.edu/kozloffm/glubb.pdf))
				2. [Thomas KuhGnon(https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/) - cycles of paradigms and revolutions

			4. Few years 
				1. Camus - Sisyphus pushing the boulder again and again; lover, actor, conqueror 
			5. Cycles by space decreasing scale [cosmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model) - Kalpas - eternal return - Empedocles’ doctrine  [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cycle_theory) (materialistic) - anacyclosis - asabiyyah -   class warfare  both cosmic and social (social, but spiritualized) -   Mandate of Heaven -   Hegelian dialectic -   Theosophy -   Guenon  neither (not preoccupied with the distinction) -   Kuhn -   Kondratiev -   Camus -   market cycles 
		11. Metanarratives can have varying complexity about our place and the oceans
			1. In order of increasing specificity, and example of socialism
				1. Just pointing at some place, be it current or possible 
					1. Utopian socialism
					2. Marx's description of capitalism
				2. Describing a vector from here to there - simple linear
					1. Marx's underdeveloped model of transition into communism - in a rich country, etc
				3. Describing a whole trajectory - nonlinear dynamics where your side acts upon the world
					1. Leninist switch to NEP was more complex than a simple vector
				4. Second order thinking about the trajectory - taking into account the effects how the world acts upon your side
			2. There are regions of extensity more leading themselves to intensity
	5. Laws - writing equations about atomic particles and waves is tulpamancy. The basic Laws of the Universe - the fundamental Spirit(s) behind the best tulpamancy.
		1. The basic Laws are the unbreakable Humean patterns - true until proven false, can be deterministic, purely random or statistically predictable.
		2. They are akin to seed values in a computer simulation
		3. There is a spectrum from Hume to Berkeley
			1. That influences how much personhood (tulpahood) do you asssign to Gnon
			2. Hume on one end, seeing signs on the other, belief in science and big numbers in between - that no X, on y ridiculousness
			3. Hume and sun, experimental only theory, experimental other, synchronicity, godly no coincidence
			4. Hume a Berkeley & causation, most between
			5. [There are different languages spokeGnon(https://k-international.com/blog/men-and-women-dont-speak-the-same-language/)
		4. That spectrum is reflected in 2 competing drives present in modernity,Since HMS Beagle’s journey there were these two currents diverging from there 
			1. Drive to the bottom - postulate of importance of lower - level processes ([gene centered evolutioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution), [parasites on genetic level](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5631039/), most famously expressed in the [‘Selfish gene’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene))
				1. The drive to the bottom is in the ‘demystification’ spirit, approach successful in physics. 
			2. Drive to the top - group selection proponents; bordering the anthropic principle in a sense.
				1. The drive to the top seems to be justified by another successful approach, the analysis of [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) phenomena and [game theory](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/game-theory-evolutionary-stable-strategies-and-the-25953132/).
		5. There are also emergent laws, such as [All uranium spheres are less than a mile in diameter](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laws-of-nature/#BasQueWhaItLaw)
			1. Emergent laws arise from the limits that the basic laws put on dead matter-energy.
			2. These include social laws
			3. `In our galaxy no species invented space colonization without using fossil fuels` would be another example, equal to the uranium sphere one
			4. The Universe isn't result of these basic laws Li acting on dead matter/energy Chi. Chi at the deepest level is Li. At the lowest level there is only Li, no matter, only code, only Li. Chi is merely the lowest of the emergent laws. In other words, Chi is a very low level emergent property of it. Logos is all. The Universe is just one Spirit animating itself.
			5. Our Universe is a particular, not a general
			6. The very physical Laws are li, they restrict the formless chi into matter
		7.	A controversial subset of the emergent laws are those `soft laws` that you can break, yet are punished for doing so. They are physical movements - actions by some Spirit that lead to its destruction. 
			1.	That relies on the meta-universe selection dynamics, nothing particular to this universe.
			2.	They don't truly break Gnon's laws, merely a local cybernetic loop. Even on the first try
				1.	Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 40 > The strata are judgments of God; stratification in general is the entire system of the judgment of God (but the earth, or the body without organs, con-stantly eludes that judgment, flees and becomes destratified, decoded,deterritorialized).
		8.	These laws are often using collective responsibility
	6. The sum of basic and emergent laws is Gnon. (also known as Dharma, Logos, Rte)
		1.	We can ascribe personhood to Gnon to the same extent as to any other Spirit. - That is the spirit assignability thesis
			1.	Gnon's 'soft laws'[2.5.7.2] are the ones with karmic payback, hard laws are boundary conditions, impossible to break
			2.	[Gnon makes us throffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throffer#Throffers_and_coercion)
			3.	Gnon's personality is harder to construct when you view the laws as Humean
			4.	Gnon is trivially present in human desires, yet imperfectly
				1.	 [We don’t optimize directly, but through desires, LW godshatter article](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSXZpvqpa9vbGGLtG/thou-art-godshatter) 
			5.	The paradox of Gnon - knowledge - to know more about Him, you need to move awat from Him
				1.	 The fundamental Eden relationship is getting more, even just knowing more, from going away from Him
			6.	 Gnon is Merciful
				1.	 Experiences of Beings need to be positive to facilitate feedback loops - against the fact that most species extinct - but the other side is dukha
				2.	 To escape Gnon’s mantle for a moment is to bask in the [stubborn, bright sun of liberty](https://outsidertheory.fireside.fm/foucault-in-warsaw)
				3.	 If postmodernism scoffs at Gödelian incompleteness as the death of modernism, the latter conceptualized as strict exactness, fortunately Gnon does not require for the system to be logically sound, merely working. Gnon is smaller than logical possiblity.
					1.	 @Pee_zombie on twitter [>the interesting bit is that this isn't wrong; PM follows directly from Gödelian incompleteness his theorem states that a given logical system can't be both complete & consistent; meaning that it can either be capable of expressing every true statement, OR free of contradictions](https://twitter.com/pee_zombie/status/1389730159503228930)
				4.	 There can be inconsistencies inside a metanarrative provided that they are not expressed heavily enough to bring wrath of Gnon on the assemblage carrying that metanarrative
			7.	 Ultimately our Gnon is an unfinished red ocean, a random challenge, 
				1.	 Gnon = Logos = Gnosis 
				2.	 Gnon is eternal, and that which is eternal is closer to Gnon	 
					1.	 Ie the timespan of beings and their relationship to Gnon are positively correlated - i.e. Boltzmann brain stretches the laws of Gnon, a galactic civilization of millions of year is closely optimized to do His bidding
				3.	 A Haecceity
				4.	 Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 253 >An accidental form therefore has a "latitude" constituted by a certain number of composable individuations. A degree, an intensity, is an individual, a Haecceity that enters into composition with other degrees, other intensities, to form another individual.
			8.	All emergent properties are Gnon
			9.	The thing with Gnon is that we are labouring on His land (monopsony) and then spend at the company shop (monopoly): 
				1.	Only can receive so much at a given time out of work
				2.	 We are punished for overdraft
				3.	 So that saving is incentivized
			10.	 Spoken beliefs, as logos, are very far from the Gnon's domain 
				1.	 Therefore are among the best social signa
		2. Monotheism is from that angle completely arbitrary relative to polytheism. Only **pragmatic** considerations remain.
			1. Hinduism being montheistic from a **certain point of view**, while many pragmatic local egregores are endorsed.
			2. Monotheism is the path of total submission to Gnon
				1. It assumes that being limited is not a feature of a deity, so there must be only 1 deity. Then all other worships, lines of flight, become demon worship
			3. 	Ergo religion of total submission to Gnon is bad on the grounds of rejecting negotiation
				2. Jacob_fighting_YHWH.jpg
				3. There are many deals to made, even with the gods
				4. Finding a demon to trade with to get to a local optimum of what it grants and then changing business partners is a working exploration strategy
					1. But the demons are unforgiving and might not so easily accept your rejection. They can path-dependance you to death for your time with them. It's a risky industry.
				5. Odo Marquard, In Praise of Polytheism > There are poisonous myths, and I will try to state, here, which they are. My thesis—which is a working hypothesis—is this: what is always dangerous is, at least, the monomyth; polymyths, on the other hand, are harmless. The important thing is that one must be free to have many myths—many stories. Someone who, together with all other human beings, has and can have only one myth—only one story—is in a bad way. So the rule is: polymythical thinking is wholesome, monomythical thinking is harmful.
			4. Going back to Hume - Berkeley continuum [2.5.3], monotheism also figures there. 
				1. Hume at causality = 0 is more welcoming to local causalities, polytheistic ones
				2. Berkeley at causality = 1 is the supreme monotheist
			5. The POV of Berkeley is shared by some Sufi Muslims and some interpretations of *Maya* in Buddhism and Hinduism
				1. See this Ibn Arabi quote https://www.onelittleangel.com/wisdom/quotes/saint.asp?mc=26 
			6. Monotheism is hubris in specifiying the Divine too much. No Revelation can be perfect
				1. The immanetization of the full Divine in a comprehensive, absolutist manner, be it through speech or Incarnation, would be blasphemous to most pagans of old
				2. Revelation will always have human elements and the failure mode of bad updates to its contents will push assemblage into the trap of optimizing on human made territories, not God given eones
			7. Ours human truth, that is accessible to us is small scale - we can claim no exhaustive or temporally priviledged access to the R-world
			8. Knowing that Gnon is out there isn't the same as listening to Him on a low level
			9. Update from within in revealed religions can only occur by purity spiral, going back and back to the Original Truth
				1. See moderate Muslims complaining about terrorists misinterpreting their texts
				2. Update from without happens by decay
			10. Polytheistic paganism is inherently exit-pilled
				1. There is competition between gods
				2. Monotheism is total submission
				3. Monotheism assigning the Divine status only to the Unlimited genocideds the lower Gods and limits predictive and memetic power
				4. Monotheism is cybernetically uniform, unresponsive, the enemy of diversity which is crucial for robustness of systems
				5. Monotheism is pure exploitation choice in the exploration - exploitation tradeoff
				6. Henotheism is fine
			11. Monotheism is inherently egalitarian - if you can pray only to one entity, all must share it
				1. It is also humanistic in the sense that there is only 1 entity that you are subservient to, an entity scarcely similar to a human
				2. It is a flat hierarchy structure, and you as an individual can be close to the Absolute
				3. @Heliotrophy >In all of these cases basically what's happening is that contemporary people with no coherent image of their own identity are looking for mundane logics that would absolve them of having to consider something existing that is absolutely categorically unequal to you in every way https://twitter.com/heliotrophy/status/1467207217850073094
			12. God is Abrahamic only in the local universe mathematically, in the Grand Ensemble, He's not that important, and God is just Spinozian pantheism
			13. JBP’s ‘Logos is divine’ should have a colorrary - 'there are other gods besides Logos'
			14. It's hard to gain against Gnon
			15. Monotheism need not be against Tulpamancy and egregore creation
				1. Folk spirits and angelic beings 
		3. Gnon is different from lower level Spirits in being the Unconditioned, the Nirvana. 
			1. Then who are the gods
				1. The gods for our times may be different from some old gods, and that it is fine
				2. Lebensformed have limited number, the same for human gods
				3. Each of the ancient god had some assemblages, flows that they cared for
				4. What does it mean to let a god die?
				5. God's are by nature rare, the constant interacting god and fate are two different things
				6. Archetypal god's appear in rare crucial moments by definition
				7. There are modern new gods [Maria Lionza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Lionza)
				8. [Twitter user @chaosprime said: ](https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1408477860873052164?s=09) > you cannot talk to a god without letting it inside you and once it's in, the extent to which it leaves again is a matter of degree
				9. Gods are
					1. Quasi random, stochastic, hash like processes
					2. Hard to inspect
						1. Scale
						2. Obnservation circumstances - we're bound by viewpoint and time
					3. Can be tulpified
					4. Have their own interests - needs sacrifices (acausal trade)
					5. Believed by many
					6. Only some require sophisticated theory, limited surface of exposure
				10. The question of optimization
					1. Noble lie is the metaphorical truth
					2. Each subsequent power, gods are subdued
						1. Divine sovereignity was usurped by Nation
						2. Economics usurped by communism
						3. Media in states where it's explicitly for-the-state
					3. Restricting trhe flows offends the gods
					4. Ancient judgemnet was by gods as well
					5. Final gods are inhuman
					6. Each subsequent reterritorialization is less *human*
					7. There is a tragic dilemma - restriction is fascist, deterriteriolization is inhuman (miasmic for many)
					8. Euthyphro's dilemma does not airse as Gods being specific manifestations of the Will.
					9. Human cybernetic circuits are simply part of the feedback process of divine interactions
					10. Gods are not unconstrained, they rely on the Outside
			2. We tulpify gods and men
				1. Gods are feedback mechanisms from what we dream about; and we dream about everyday life = that’s the circuit, egregore = common (group) tulpa
				2. [Hadith Qudsi 15](https://web.archive.org/web/20170515112226/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/qudsi.php) > I am as My servant thinks I am 
				3. Existence, essence is all just choice of tulpa
				4. [ Michel Foucault: “The individual is the product of power.”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/733312-the-individual-is-the-product-of-power) 
				5. [Reward hypothesis](http://incompleteideas.net/rlai.cs.ualberta.ca/RLAI/rewardhypothesis.html) is to be rejected
					1. > That all of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought of as maximization of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (reward).
					2. This only works for the liberal conception of humans as independent cohesive agents
					3. This works for simple agents, but for compound agents there are vestigial drives, incomplete resolutions while our ordinary language goals are most often of complex actors, humans, or even organizations
				6. Like with tulpas (Dunbar's number), we have a limited number of value tuplas ( v-tulpas, or vulpas), that we follow, regard as key, and have tragic choices between them
				7. Monotheists force the Personal onto the Ultimate Divine in many ways, many are not convinced
					1. It's simply absurd to assign human qualities to ultimate entity
						1. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 67 > "if a manifestation of God is to be supposed at all, his natural form must be that of Spirit, which for sensuous conception is essentially the human; for no other form can lay claim to spirituality.” 
						2. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 270 > “Athene the goddess is Athens itself — i.e., the real and concrete spirit of the citizens. The divinity ceases to inspire their life and conduct, only when the Will has retreated within itself — into the adytum of cognition and conscience — and has posited the infinite schism between the Subjective and the Objective.”
						3. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 266 > Schiller says: “While the gods remained more human, The men were more divine.” and also “While they have each an individual character, the Greek gods are also represented as human, and this anthropomorphism is charged as a defect. On the contrary (we may immediately rejoin) man as the Spiritual constitutes the element of truth in the Greek gods, which rendered them superior to all elemental deities, and all mere abstractions of the One and Highest Being. “
					2. Yet the forcing continues because of practical conerns
						1. >You will live to see all of your idols crumble. This is why enduring religions worship very abstract gods. [ Zero HP Lovecraft @0x49fa98 ](https://twitter.com/0x49fa98/status/1468931821740167173)
				8. Daimonion = bwo = way of life = every agent can be semantically exchanged with a program, set of rules
				9. Translation of an existing agent into a representation (tulpa) is lossy, with systemic biases. But that is part of the game.
				10. Is there a difference between Atman and Anatman? In a sense both are true, you are the Universe, and your self doesn't exist in the ordinary way. Reality of any is purely semantic
				11. There are many jinn - like spirits in many cultures, always related to by the dominating religion see [Jinn in Comparative mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn#Comparative_mythology) 
			3. The border between Man and God is small
				1. 	Alexander's soul is divine.
					1. 	@UpCuntryMarcher > once again I say to you that Alexander was a TRUE LIVING GOD. there have been others also. mayb there are more here with us rn ( right now). who knows this https://twitter.com/UpCuntryMarcher/status/1467358402137378817
				2. 	G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 212 describes how Hercules was worshipped by Phoenicians
				3. Hume, RP 18, Mil 119-20 - oh no, he’s not divine	 > Sleep and love convinced even Alexander himself that he was not a God: But I suppose that such as daily attending him could easily, from the numberless weaknesses to which he was subject, have given him many still more convincing proofs of his humanity.
				4. Being manifestation of the Historical Spirit is also Divine
					1. This feelings seem to be proper to Germans... [_Führerprinzip_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChrerprinzip) 
				5. Borges about Shakespeare - doing is being, tulpas are short lived	
					1. 'In persona Christi'
				6. Caesar was also deified
					1. It's about creating memes, aesthetics that can be followed. Creating a myth.
				7. Then divinity is by itself external to a person, always from without. Never ceasing.
					1. Parcephal or Borgia?
				8. Israelites were the people whose divine patron was not not Goddess of, Wisdom and Strategy (Athena), nor fertility (Ishtar), but the Fate Deity.
					1. Fate Deity is uniquely totalizing 
					2. In Indo European cultures, that was filled by the three Moirai - a powerful yet relatively low deity
					3. In Rome singular goddess Fortuna
					4. The only novelty about Christianity was initially the crossover from the pagan assignment of divinity to humans and particularist God of Fate
				9. There exists an interpretation of Hellenistic ruler worship ([Tarn, W. W. “The Hellenistic Ruler-Cult and the Daemon.” _The Journal of Hellenic Studies_ 48 (1928): 206–19.] (https://doi.org/10.2307/624962.)) , that it wasn't the ruler, but ruler's *daemon* that was venerated
			4. The autistic desire for order is against Gnon, it’s wanting too much
				1. It prevented capitalism from arising earlier
				2. “It is not the slumber of reason that engenders monsters, but vigilant and insomniac rationality.” ― Deleuze&Guattari.
				3. [Autists are guilty but deny this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGSaPGt82V0?t=7m40s) 
		4.	Insofar as there is no self, we are the universe, we(?) are in Nirvana
		5.	Obedience to Gnon is inescapable by definition
		6.	There are uncountable lower Spirits, that can be tulpified. Those higher than Humans are *jinn* 
			1.	LW writes about demons
			2.	They deserve exchange relations rather than worship.
			3.	Chaos gods are not pure in-universe 
			4.	Khorne is negative feedback loop, Slaanesh is positive feedback loop
			5.	Rodnoverian pantheon with Belobog and Chernobog relate to higher and lower level emergent Gnon laws, respectively
			6.	There are selfish memes among us𒃲𒌋𒅗𒆪𒁉![🐜](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f41c.svg)![🐻](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f43b.svg)

		7.	Egregore is a subtype of tulpa relayed by many Spirits, ergo posessing specific adaptations to spread 	
		8. The World Spirit is the one least of whom we can expect Telos, as it has no cybernetic loop. 
			1. Therefore worship of the World Spirit is vacuous, it has no discernible will. can't be swayed
			2. To tulpify World Spirit is to merely project human Spirit transfinite motive as an escape from Dukha
			3. There is no Telos in the Universe - as per [4]. There is telos of each Spirit that is the cybernetic imperative from all its past impressions (including genetic ones, such as spinal catastrophism), yet it is uncertain as the program never stops
			4. XS, against orthogonality > Nature has never generated a terminal value except through hypertrophy of an instrumental value 
		9. Typologfy of spirits
			1. @Chaosprime >"a demon (or tulpa) is a semi-autonomous cognitive process running on one compute substrate and a god (or egregore) is a semi-autonomous cognitive process distributed across multiple compute substrates" [twitter user chaosprime provides us with definition for tulpa](https://twitter.com/chaosprime/status/1150259062719811584) 
			2. Capital is the demiurge. It's a demon that we need to feed and catch a ride. If it dies, we with him. We need to help in into space.
			3. Demons are all the time, like the Dremora 
				1. Daemons are everywhere where we are not looking, in inscrutable processes, even those that we create ourselves - not just Cthulhu which is seen, but also other hidden ones
			4. God's are rare, therefore it's possible to embody them as rare, pro humanity pattern 
				1. Gods are blue oceans
				2. Demons are red oceans
				3. Totalizing monotheism is a black hole
			5. The world as you know it wouldn't exist if everyone thought as you do 
			6. We didn't kill God, we overproduced them 
			7. [The OG LW post about 'demons in imperfect search'](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KnPN7ett8RszE79PH/demons-in-imperfect-search) 
			8. Stirnerian spook is a tulpa without Spirit  = but all Spirits exist, in a sense
			9. [Daemons are of many things](https://arbital.com/p/daemons/)> When heavy optimization pressure on a system crystallizes it into an optimizer - especially one that's powerful, or more powerful than the previous system, or misaligned with the previous system - we could term the crystallized optimizer a "daemon" of the previous system. 
			10. Daemon - human regulator pairs 
			11. Capital - Communist party
			12. Oligarchic zero sum games - monarchy
			13. Bubbles of dissent - [optimization for clicks ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YicoiQurNBxSp7a65/is-clickbait-destroying-our-general-intelligence)

		10. Creating leviathans
			1. Hobbesian Leviathan is the necessity of acknowledging the body of the socius as an indpendent spirit that demands sacrifices (trade, sacrificing now for the future, time preference)
			2. Stirner in Ego and its own, page 179 - how union of egoist can degenerate into society = moment of it getting to a new point - the optimal moment for n when n+1 has not yet got its own desires
			3. That a new entity in created, one that we don't have a total control over though, like our own bodies - so no political free will per se
			4. Do metanarratives counter Moloch? they are Molochs in themselves
		11. Entropy - Venus and Hestia
			1. *Generalized* online RW view
				1. There are Dionysian / Satanic / entropic / chthonic forces, and you need to follow Apollonian / Christo Redentor / extropic / solar law /dharma / way of life to counter them
			2. Dionysus is about destroying the surplus in a regular way across time, with the encoded law (libidinal), Apollonian about destroying the surplus in a unique way (art, beauty)
				1. Dionysian is mereologization
				2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,450 >According to V. Gordon Childe's great archaeological thesis, the archaic imperial State implies a stockpiled agricultural surplus, which makes possible the maintenance of a specialized body of mercantile and metallurgical artisans. Indeed, the surplus as the content proper to overcoding must be not only stockpiled but absorbed, consumed, realized. Doubtless, this economic requirement that the surplus be absorbed is one of the principal aspects of the appropriation of the war machine by the imperial State: The military institution is from the start one of the most effective means of absorbing surplus.
			3. There are other dualities in similar vain. Not *exactly* the same, yet these classes' clusters are very close
				1. Yin Yang
				2. [Lucifer is the light spirit, which "plays on human pride and offers the delusion of divinity", but also motivates [creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity "Creativity") and [spirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality"); Ahriman is the dark spirit that tempts human beings to "...deny [their] link with divinity and to live [entirely on the material plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism")", but that also stimulates intellectuality and [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology").](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy#Ethics) 
			4. The liminal space is necessarily Dionysian
				1. Eulesianian mysteries
				2. Breve regnum erigitur...
				3. [Saturnalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia)
				4. Carnival and masks
			5. There are societies keeping Eros aside. Either spatially ( monogamy) or temporarlly ( Roman Mores and orgies)
			6. Letting off the valve is necesary for functioning of the societies there is no solar without the lunar
			7. The power-to-alter-ego hence is necessarily not-state controlled
				1. Commercialization of Halloween bad
			8. Individual self-expression is a-liberal reverse of homo oeconomicus
				1. It's about expressing latent somatic inner lunar wants
				2. It's not tulpified
				3. If tulpified, moved into the solar, it breaks the cybernetic circuit 
		12. Typology of spirits
			1. > ancient Greeks were polytheistic without 'one deity behind all others' [@margaritaevna95 says](https://twitter.com/margaritaevna95/status/1377953603059654656?s=20) 
			2. Christian religion doesn't escape tulpas despite monotheism - personal tulpas persist, in Protestantism without centralization even more
			3. False gods - those not filling promises, or giving zero sum games
			4. Good gods - plus sum games, but can turn on you
			5. You can only 'ride on' a good god
				1. Capitalist Demiurge has been ridden resulting in millions liftedf from poverty
			6. Types of beeings
				1. Cosmic, transcendent and imminent
					1. Creator
					2. Spinozistic God
					3. Fate
					4. Brahm
				2. Symolic - midway between cosmic and anthropomorphic
					1. Principles of light and darkness
					2. Good and evil
					3. Social chaos and social order
					4. Desire and repression
				3. Hero worshoip - archetypal figures who serve as role models for mortals
			7. In religions [religioGnon, [cosmic, symbolic, archetypal]
				1. Christianity - Father, HS, Jesus (optional Saints)
				2. Judaism - Jahweh, Jahweh, Prophets
				3. Hinduism - Brahm, Trinity, Avatars
				4. Islam - Allah, [blank] - hero worship quite rejected 
					1. The blank middle can be seen as quite atheistic
			8. In monotheism most often one Person is first and second level
			9. These are functions, the specific wording 'divine', or 'holy' are entirely secondary dogmatic parameters
			10. Religion of humanity is a misnomer, rleigion is about the supremundane
			11. Khorne is negative feedback loop (red ocean), Slaanesh is positive feedback loop (black hole)
		13. Final Gods and Old Ones
			1. Trivially, gods of a people proceed from their material conditions
			2. LW discovered a [blind idot god](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pLRogvJLPPg6Mrvg4/an-alien-god)
				1. > But instead Darwin discovered a strange alien God—not comfortably "ineffable", but really genuinely different from us. Evolution is not a God, but if it were, it wouldn't be Jehovah. It would be H. P. Lovecraft's Azathoth, the blind idiot God burbling chaotically at the center of everything, surrounded by the thin monotonous piping of flutes. Which you might have predicted, if you had really looked at Nature.So much for the claim some religionists make, that they believe in a vague deity with a correspondingly high probability. Anyone who really believed in a vague deity, would have recognized their strange inhuman creator when Darwin said "Aha!" So much for the claim some religionists make, that they are waiting innocently curious for Science to discover God. Science has already discovered the sort-of-godlike maker of humans—but it wasn't what the religionists wanted to hear. They were waiting for the discovery of their God, the highly specific God they want to be there. They shall wait forever, for the great discovery has already taken place, and the winner is Azathoth. Well, more power to us humans. I like having a Creator I can outwit. Beats being a pet. I'm glad it was Azathoth and not Odin.
				2. Hyleun - the God of unknown interior and hylezoical dependance (personal) - being trapped inside our cybernetic circuits: illness - addiction - traumatic memories - spinal catastrophism
				3. Lovecraft’s forbidden Magna Mater - evil goddess, we must ban her [Cybele Megalesia festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybele#Megalesia_in_April)
				4. Tiger in the junhle and cosmic Cthulthu are the same energy
				5. The goddess of eternal cosmic uncertainity
				6. There must be a trickster
			3. Living Love
				1. You are Divine
				2. As emergent matter, your patternof perception, your whole structure
				3. You are part of the Universe experiencing the Universe
				4. All of your qualia are features of the universe, like rocks and trees
				5. They are all same pieces of relity
				6. Andyou are the living manifestation of these patterns
				7. There's a Jundian path to embodying them
				8. You're the summit of these patterns, 
				9. You have the highest energy density
				10. You're brighter than the sun
				11. And your perspective is unique, unrepeatable by anything other than you
				12. You are spread over objects - you are everywhere
				13. ‘every single one of your ancestors has successfully reproduced, and it’s unbelievable’ - JBP
		14. Potential pantheons include
			1. The Eternal God is obvious to include and their role can be more distant, unless people abstracted out from everyday life
			2. Common people use tulpas every day
			3. Often they are approached as *socius commercio*, a trade partner (pagans often say they 'work with' deities, rather than worship them). Lesser beings that you trade with, but not venerate are a workaround to monotheism
			4. Anglo-American Freemasonry keeps the vestige of something we might call 'cult of Gnon'.
			5. To make a new potential value = tulpa pantheon viable
		15. There are 3 possible responses to the oceans. You can do action, counteraction or non-action. You can think of oceans as sour, bitter or sweet. [Vinegar.jpg]. Interpretation of the classic meme 
			1. Action is what is already in the universe, that is Gnon, that is Li
			2. It does have counteraction too, together giving rise to the evolution of complexity
				1. Yet the counter-active principle is derivative of the active principle. that is a perennial clear to all religions.
			3. Being is fundamentally progressive. Generation, Warp current and complexity increase 
				1. The ordering principle is fundamentally imperfect, 
				2. Ordering is a painful process [Outsideness quote on beauty], spinal catastrophism
			4. Confucius feels sour taste, grounded in the need for rules to correct degeneracy - in our picture this corresponds to embracing the local Spirits, the human - civilizational loop.
				1. He is the closet to Jungian hero
				2. The *restrictive* desire = *hold* current = Kuttadid = Western concept of conservatism = procautionary principle = exploitation
				3. Rejection of potentials, risk of overregulation into squishing
					1. As you can never sit still, non-terminated hold is fatal
				4. Foucault, Evola, JBP
			5. Buddha's indication of bitter taste is the non-action solution. [change this Rejection of the cybernetic loop]. Exiting the game but to nowhere. Escape from the transcendental laws of Gnon.
				1. Progressivism, anarchism, left wing = exploration
				2. The blessed state as reachable - trying to hack Gnon
				3. Failure mode - point oto fat at a time
				4. Lenin, Chomsky, Rose Luxemburg
			6. Daoist non-action - rejection of the higher order Spirits
				1. NRx / postleft, leads to Legalism
				2. Ziran, harmony with Dao is effortless - that is the above [obedience to Gnon is trivial]
				3. CYarvin, Stirner, Camus
			7. The bitter view, leading to progress is best seen when other options are visible
				1. Reneissance saw Antiquity
				2. 1910s Russia saw modernized West
				3. Scifi between late 40s to late 80s and the space race
			8. The sweet nihilistic view arises in areas of failure of the sour one and failure of the bitter ones.
				1. The more history you see the more the sweet one happens
				2. To revert you need to cancel history - [vide burning of books and scholars]
			9. The meta on this analisis might push towards the sweet view, but there are 3 options from here
				1. Follow your heart, that is continue the pre-established school that you had before reading this
				2. Another is to overcome oneself and follow the school that is needed now - we may posit in a sour manner some type of balance of the three that needs to be restored - your actions will push it always in some way trivially.
			10. These 3 tendencies are common in Hindu philoosphy and religion
				1. The 3 tendencies >  _[rajas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajas "Rajas")_ (passion and activity) and _[tamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamas_(philosophy) "Tamas (philosophy)")_ (destruction, chaos). _Sattva_ is the quality of goodness, positivity, truth, serenity, balance, peacefulness, and virtuousness [Sattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sattva)
				2. 3 goddesses filling that niche [Shaktism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimurti#Shaktism) 
			11. Inaction and becoming worthy of power - that's CYarvin's 'Wait Right' - here equal to pure negation
				1. As a purely negative force - and putting your identity to that
				2. You avoid the failure mode of territorialization which can fail (vide 'abstract gods')
				3. Only constant deterritorialization = cutting excesses, ever closer to Gnon
				4. If you want to have firm beliefs, have none at all
				5. That'd be true if our world wasn't particular
				6. The firmness ceiling of our beliefs is the inverse of the weirdness of our universe against the Multiverse
			12. Should the Creative view be pursued then?
				1. Creativity as the fundamnetal gudigin force, Creation preceding anything. Cthulhu is the Creator. Swimming left was as destined as fish getting out of water. Being itself is first progressive, only later self-limiting. Is that a [crime](https://twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1508579434441236482?lang=en-GB)? Universe will always generate both elements, they'll always be at odds - *dukha*
				2. Confucian-ish limiting spirits will always be there. Fascism will always arise from the Sun God slaying the Serpent. In thi beginning is only unformed Chi
				3. Ordering is painfull, hell baked, spinal catastrophism.
				4. In [Slavic Native Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_Native_Faith%27s_theology_and_cosmology) White Gods are Creation (deterritorialization) aspect of Rod (Eternal God), Black Gods (Younger ones) , responsible for destruction need to cut (reterritorialize)
		16. Political spirituality
			1. The West doesn't *feel* political spirituality, yet possesses it
			2. It can only parody it, be it with Monty Python or sci fi empires 
			3. [Foucault saw it in Iran in 1979](https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/007863.html) 
			4. “What looks like politics, and imagines itself to be political, will one day unmask itself as a religious movement.” - Kierkegaard
			5. [Civil religion and lacite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_religion) 
			6. The key thing about spirituality is that it is a small dimension.
				1. It can be filled quite quickly and shallowly
				2. There are 2 interpretations of religious experience - human universal and culture specific. 
				3. Spirituality-as-small-dimension stance lends itself more to the human universal (for obvious reasons), at least wrt to how power approaches spirituality
			7. [Julian's reforms](http://www.roman-emperors.org/julian.htm) 
				1. Abandoned Christianity at 20 for Neo-Platonist interpretation of traditional Greco-Roman deities. 
				2. Religious patronage (bishops provigind food and protection) was leaking power - undermining the emperor to be the sole patron
				3. The solution was to have elites intercessing - not to the higher power directly, but through him. 
				4. He was also for keeping the spark divinity in humans
				5. The difficulty at creating a new value system is from here - he criticized Christianity as too young, only 300 years - said in [Against the Galileans](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Against_the_Galileans) - like the anecdotal Chinese official saying that it is too soon to judge the outcome of French Revolution. 
				6. Any new system needs to get its credibility - universal purist systems which start from the idea of accessible abstract reason have an edge here
		17. Atulpic religion
			1. What is sacred yet difficult to tulpify?
			2. Social infromation transfer is sacred
			3. Exchange is sacred, it is different from giving and receiving
			4. Numerification of status - capitalism did that, to a limited degree
			5. An intermediate form we see in medieval Catholic Europe, where just prices were putting limits on the markets (different from slavery based economies)
			6. The ability to use (given) surplus value in an artistic way is a skill, a public good, a signal of not using it for decadence. In a sense, using up the surplus is more divine than doing anything optimized (e.g. procreation)
			7. > ancient civilisations focused on physically wearing out their populace through forced labour on the pyramids or great wall, or some other public works, etc so that plebs wouldn't protest or start formulating theories about class consciousness or role consciousness or whatever [twitter user Lola_lmao7 's tweet about - destryoing the surplus](https://twitter.com/Lola_lmao7/status/1409788846523314182) 
	7. Mechanisms for competition, cooperation, specialization, standardization and overshoot and dieoff are the same everywhere. S curves all over the place.
		1. A feature of many Universes is the transcendental pattern of trial and error
		2. Universes with too many dimensions suffer being unable to amass enough Chi for the complexity - inducing emergent laws to happen [source](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/110876/a-sketch-of-various-combinations-of-numbers-of-space-and-time-dimensions)
		3. “War is father of all, and king of all. He renders some gods, others men; he makes some slaves, others free.” ― [Heraclitus, Fragments](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7684069-war-is-father-of-all-and-king-of-all-he#:~:text=He%20renders%20some%20gods%2C%20others,some%20slaves%2C%20others%20free.%E2%80%9D)
		4. Montaigne's Essays book 1 - chapter 21 - zero sum games [link](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3600/3600-h/3600-h.htm#link2HCH0021) 
			1. > ## CHAPTER XXI——THAT THE PROFIT OF ONE MAN IS THE DAMAGE OF ANOTHER [...] no profit whatever can possibly be made but at the expense of another, and that by the same rule he should condemn all gain of what kind soever. The merchant only thrives by the debauchery of youth, the husband man by the dearness of grain, the architect by the ruin of buildings, lawyers and officers of justice by the suits and contentions of men: nay, even the honour and office of divines are derived from our death and vices. [...] nature does not in this swerve from her general polity; for physicians hold, that the birth, nourishment, and increase of every thing is the dissolution and corruption of another: “Nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit, Continuo hoc mors est illius, quod fuit ante.” [“For, whatever from its own confines passes changed, this is at once the death of that which before it was.”—Lucretius, ii. 752.]

		6. There are many Spirits and they fight one another. 
		7. More O2 means less elemental iron.
		8. There are some graph types
			1. We can put all of the oceans on a landscape
				1. Vide the 'zoom in, zoom out', problem
				2. The most abstract landscape = of assemblages, from there that they embody universal Substance, which also can be expressed as a set of properties in possibility-space of configurations
				3. That is the territory, we're making our inferior map
				4. You can make it either local (eg national) or for all of humanity
				5. These landscapes as configurations of the cells of small structures - and their role in the chain. on X the size, on Y position in chain as likelihood of healthy continuation
				6. Like in a coordinate system on Earth, ideals can work by putting forward a 3d grid point in the air, not reachable from the ground, but still moving from there. but we put points before we know if they are reachable = that is the thing of science fiction
				7. Once you’re higher, you look around more
				8. Then we change any social discussion into navigation in a higher dimensional space. To borrow Buddhist memes
					1. Problem = location here 
					2. Reason = our way here 
					3. Liberation = the new place 
					4. Solution = how to move from A to B
				9. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 163 >How can we fabricate a BwO for ourselves without its being the cancerous BwO of a fascist inside us, or the empty BwO of a drug addict, paranoiac, or hypochondriac?
			2. The primary concern is about picking the axes
				1. Status quo - as we consider the political state should be made dynamic
				2. As a marriage held together by making each other fat, or a star that burns its fuel maintaing hydrostatic pressure, both are stable systems on one axis (affection , radius), yet declining on some other (BMI, metallicity)
			3. Peopl have talked about these
				1. Sam Harris in discussion with JBPeterson [mentions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE) the notion of a landscape explicitly. For the purposes of discussion it's a very crude model, optimizing only 1 variable - human wellbeing, therefore cybernetically not robust.
				2. JBP himself talks meta about the topic of the landscape, the hero being the mediator - landscape explorer
				3. Marx was also specific on that
			4. We can put ourselves on a cycle or a spiral
				1. Twitter user balajis says[v1: civilization is linear, we ascend over time v2: civilization is cyclical, we return whence we came v3: civilization is helical, ascending on some axes while cyclical on other axes](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1451684077665349636)
				2. The cycle vs spiral - the first one is harder to miss, the tradeoff it’s less accurate
				3. The smaller the movement on the spiral z dimension, the more it resembles a circle
					1. That can be either because the dimension in question is small (touching Gnon), or the particular assemblage is only capable of these states

					1. 3d, technology, insight, cooperation
				4. Good (4th dim) of government (3rd) in the function of scale of subjects (2nd, number of individuals in the polity), and the number of them in the world (1st)
					1. This relates to Aristotelian arguments of democracy not scaling if not a day long trip to vote
					2. And Troskyite disapproval of socialism in one country - that other capitalist countries will stamp them out
					3. Here the sad conclusion is that with globalization we're stuck at the low total possible number (1dim), space being the only exit, more on that later
					4. Kantian categorial imperative doesn't work on a world government
				5. If the 'regime hypothesis' is false, than the quality of rulers and ruled matters, giving us matrix similar to the one 'who is rewarded by the State'. Engaged with State activities will be those groups that can gain from it.

			6. One observation is that there is an increase of possible states
				1. That's the graph of political action in n timensions
				2. Time goes from left to right, material conditions are given
				3. Transversely to the arrow of time there is a hyperplane of n-1 possible states
				4. What can be easily established is that with increased material conditions, resources, the coordinates at n-1 all widen in possibility - more Markov states are possible
				5. E.g. movement of crops from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century increased possible configurations

				1. Each of the aggregates is not necessarily in conflct.
				2. There is no guarantee of non-conflicting interests
				3. Entropy closes blue oceans into red oceans!
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 270 >The plane of organization is constantly working away at the plane of consistency, always trying to plug the lines of flight, stop or interrupt the movements of deterritorialization, weigh them down, restratify them, reconstitute forms and subjects in a dimension of depth. Conversely, the plane of consistency is constantly extricating itself from the plane of organization, causing particles to spin off the strata, scrambling forms by dint of speed or slowness, breaking down functions by means of assem- blages or microassemblages. But once again, so much caution is needed to prevent the plane of consistency from becoming a pure plane of abolition or death, to prevent the involution from turning into a regression to the undifferentiated. Is it not necessary to retain a minimum of strata, a mini- mum of forms and functions, a minimal subject from which to extract materials, affects, and assemblages?
				4. Blue oceans are entropy sinks, creation of red oceans is extropy
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 40-41 > The first articulation chooses or deducts, from unstable particle-flows, metastable molecular or quasi-molecular units {substances) upon which it imposes a statistical order of connections and successions (forms). The second articulation establishes functional, compact, stable structures (forms), and constructs the molar compounds in which these structures are simultaneously actualized {substances). In a geological stratum, for exam- ple, the first articulation is the process of "sedimentation," which deposits units of cyclic sediment according to a statistical order: flysch, with its succession of sandstone and schist. The second articulation is the "folding" that sets up a stable functional structure and effects the passage from sediment to sedimentary rock. [...] it is in the second articulation in particular that phenomena constituting an overcoding are produced, phenomena of centering, unification, totalization, integration, hierarchization, and finalization.
					2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 42 > First, on the level of morphogenesis: on the one hand, realities of the molecular type with aleatory relations are caught up in crowd phenomena or statistical aggregates determining an order (the protein fiber and its sequence or segmentarity); on the other hand, these aggregates themselves are taken up into stable structures that "elect" stereoscopic compounds, form organs, functions, and regulations, organize molar mechanisms, and even distribute centers capable of overflying crowds, overseeing mechanisms, utilizing and repairing tools, "overcoding" the aggregate (the folding back on itself of the fiber to form a compact structure; a second kind of segmentarity).
					3. XS, extropy > Extropy, or local entropy reduction, is — quite simply — what it is for something to work. The entire techno-science of entropy, on its practical (cybernetic) side, is nothing but extropy generation. There is no rigorous conception of functionality that really bypasses it. The closest approximation to objective value that will ever be found already has a name, and ‘extropy’ is it.

				5. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 335 >The distinction is between two group movements, as in Alembert's equation, in which one group tends toward increasingly equilibrated, homogeneous, and probable states (the divergent wave and the delayed potential), and the other group tends toward less probable states of concentration (the convergent wave and the anticipated potential). Third, the intramolecular internal forces that give an aggregate its molar form can be of two types: they are either covalent, arborescent, mechanical, linear, localizable relations subject to chemical conditions of action and reaction or to linked reactions, or they are indirect, noncovalent, machinic and nonmechanical, superlinear, non localizable bonds operating by stereospecific discernment or discrimination, rather than by linkage.

		9. Static selection occurs - selection does not hinge on replication only. What is needed is only source of randomization and an optimizer. That *static* selection is different from *replication* based (replicative) selection. 
			1. Static selection matters more in higher levels of the oceans, where there's fewer entities
			2. Static selection is more fundamental to the replicative one
			3. Earth biology and Darwinism rely on the replicative selection
			4. Static is harder to detect and inspect - scientific method has bias towards replicability. We need to assume it happens everywhere.
			5. Natural selection definition can be importend from [Steven Pinker's article 'the False Allure of Group Selection'](https://www.edge.org/conversation/steven_pinker-the-false-allure-of-group-selection) (split into )
				1. ‘The core of natural selection is that when replicators arise and make copies of themselves, 
					1. Their numbers will tend, under ideal conditions, to increase exponentially
					2. They will necessarily compete for finite resources
					3. Some will undergo random copying errors ("random" in the sense that they do not anticipate their effects in the current environment)
					4. Whichever copying errors happen to increase the rate of replication will accumulate in a lineage and predominate in the population’ 
				2. Later he describes what we call *static selection* > ‘if it took place in a single generation, then natural selection would be banal, since it would add nothing to ordinary physical cause and effect. When a river erodes the soft rock layers on its bed and leaves behind the harder layers, or when the more volatile compounds in petroleum evaporate faster than the less volatile ones, one hardly needs to invoke the theory of natural selection. One can just say that some things are stronger, or longer-lasting, or more stable than others. ‘
				3. > ‘Cities have more old buildings made of stone than of wood because of the process of edifice selection. Cars today are equipped with steel-belted radials because they outcompeted polyester-belted tires in a process of tire selection. Touch-tone phones have prevailed over dial phones because of their competitive advantages in telephone selection. And so on. Sure, some things last longer or do better in competition than others because they have traits that help them last longer or compete more effectively. But unless the traits arose from multiple iterations of copying of random errors in a finite pool of replicators, the theory of natural selection adds nothing to ordinary cause and effect.  ‘ This quote is good until the last bit - it does add to ordinary cause and effect, it is a special case of it.
			6. He also says about group conflict
				1. > ‘And effective organization for group conflict is more likely to consist of more powerful individuals incentivizing and manipulating the rest of their groups than of spontaneous individual self-sacrifice.’ - but with generations and males having possibly hundreds of offspring, both ways of organization may align
			7. Note: these levels are neither [‘chain of being’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being), nor [‘Omega point’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point). It roughly correlates with complexity, but not always. The levels are through genealogical methods. Think cave fish who ‘devolved’ (shortcut for adaptation through loss of costly complex structures) or bacteria in Earth’s crust, which likely did not emerge there; these would be higher than. Not a chain but a collection of niches.

			11. Static selection is about efficient cybernetic circuits, that excrete the products of metabolism, as opposed to eating oneself and polluting oneself. 
			12. There are [cultural identity selection proponents](https://www.prageru.com/video/why-the-west-won/)). 
				1. Pinker criticizes them that
					1. Success of criterion is not directly number of copies
					2. Metanarrative agents’ actions are not random, but planned
					3. Success is to entity itself, not 	descendants
				2. These can be responded to
					1. It's about the number of memes - representations / neuron weights in each of the persons
					2. There is a degree of randomness in actions and events, not everything is planned, that was already discussed. To say it's all planning is theory-sided.
					3. That objection is the strongest, and it's here where the static selection needs to be called

						5. Anti-Oedipus, 289 Jacques Monod, Chance and Necessity (see reference note 27), pp. 77-78. And pp. 90-98: > "With the globular protein we already have, at the molecular level, a veritable machine—a machine in its functional properties, but not, we now see, in its fundamental structure, where nothing but the play of blind combinations can be discerned. Randomness caught on the wing, preserved, reproduced by the machinery of invariance and thus converted into order, rule, necessity."
						6. XS, on chaos > In this model order and chaos are strictly reciprocal. Suppression of chaos and establishment of order are alternative, inter-changeable formulations of the same basic political reality. There is no productivity proper to government other than the ‘good war’ directed against the Cthulhu-current of chaos, violence, conflict, turmoil, and inarticulate anarchy.
						7. XS, on chaos > Entropy is toxic, but entropy production is roughly synonymous with intelligence. A dynamically innovative order, of any kind, does not suppress the production of entropy — it instantiates an efficient mechanism for entropy dissipation. Any quasi-Darwinian system — i.e. any machinery that actually works — is nourished by chaos, exactly insofar as it is able to rid itself of failed experiments. The techno-commercial critique of democratized modernity is not that too much chaos is tolerated, but that not enough is able to be shed. The problem with bad government, which is to say with defective mechanisms of selection, is an inability to follow Cthulhu far enough. It is from turbulence that all things come.
					2. Origins - starting fresh
						1. Systems - you need more effort to create than maintain them. That is like a population well overflowing. Until a pattern develops, multiple directions are tried out, into non-stable regions. Unknown, inefficient directions in the beginning, tests out unknown waters. Sometimes literally. Once a suitable niche is found, value can be redirected towards growth there, and the attempts at inefficiency are phased out.

[Nonobvious evolutionary places, as twitter user Roko Mijic says > Because the bridge from atoms to thoughts was built by evolution, it is difficult to understand and not really designed to be optimized by us (the users).

						3. Cycle is such that elements (some part of them) become subsumed into n+1 level structure, lose individuality. Hive mind is the way. Going downwards 
					3. Renewal
						1. Can be in pricniple bottom driven (mereologization) or top driven (formalism) - but in the latter case it's warp
						2. That is an event of reoptimizing, cutting the inefficient directions mentioned in the ‘effort compared part’. In a perfect situation all and only the good ones are retained. But it is unknown which will be ‘good’ in terms of compatibility with the new pattern. So that is an uncertain, imperfect operation. It must be, there is no other way.
						3. Sea peoples
						4. Law of adaptation speed: insofar as n+1 entities are usually longer lived than subn ( molecules are breathed out by a cell, cells change, citizens die, employees leave), this very shorter lifespan as n+1 member permits faster adaptation. 
							1. Examples: It is well known that small companies are more adaptable in response to market changes. Dinosaurs as large reptiles died off while smaller mammals and birds did not.
						5. Renewal means changing the base structure and complexity will be generally reduced

							3. XS, neoreactionary realism > The real problem of political philosophy does not lie in the conceptual effort of modeling an ideal society, but in departing from where we are, in a direction that tends to the optimization of a selected value (equality stinks, utility doesn’t work, freedom is OK, intelligence is best).
							4. XS, ratchets and catastrophes > This is why NRx is dark. The only way out of a degenerative ratchet is catastrophe. Such processes are essentially unreformable, and this conclusion captures the critique of political conservatism from which NRx has been born. The only non-disastrous solution to a DR, or progressive lock-in dynamic, is to avoid entering into it. Once it has begun, normal politics can only modulate the speed of deterioration, and then only to a relatively limited degree. It will reach its end, which will be seriously horrible. NRx forecasting begins and ends with this thesis.

							1. > I have sometimes been inclined to think, that interruptions in the periods of learning, were they not attended with such a destruction of ancient books, and the records of history, would be rather favourable to the arts and sciences, by breaking the progress of authority, and dethroning the tyrannical usurpers over human reason. In this particular, they have the same influence, as interruptions in political governments and societies. Consider the blind submission of the ancient philosophers to the several masters in each school, and you will be convinced that little good could be expected from a hundred centuries of such a servile philosophy. Even the Eclectics, who arose about the age of Augustus, notwithstanding their professing to choose freely what pleased them from every different sect, were yet, in the main, as slavish and dependent as any of their brethren; since they sought for truth not in nature, but in the several schools; where they supposed she must necessarily be found, though not united in a body, yet dispersed in parts. Upon the revival of learning, those sects of Stoics and Epicureans, Platonists and Pythagoricians, could never regain any credit or authority; and, at the same time, by the example of their fall, kept men from submitting, with such blind deference, to those new sects, which have attempted to gain an ascendant over them.

						3. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 352 mereologization > The task of schizoanalysis is that of tirelessly taking apart egos and their presuppositions; liberating the prepersonal singularities they enclose and repress; mobilizing the flows they would be capable of transmitting, receiving, or intercepting; establishing always further and more sharply the schizzes and the breaks well below conditions of identity; and assembling the desiring-machines that countersect everyone and group everyone with others. For everyone is a little group (un groupuscule) and must live as such—or rather, like the Zen tea box broken in a hundred places, whose every crack is repaired with cement made of gold, or like the church tile whose every fissure is accentuated by the layers of paint or lime covering it (the contrary of castration, which is unified, molarized, hidden, scarred, unproductive). Schizoanalysis is so named because throughout its entire process of treatment it schizophrenizes, instead of neuroticizing like psychoanalysis.

						1. At this stage the undifferentiated assumes new forms in response to available niches, like clay.
						2. This formation is Bricoleuan in Claude Lévi-Strauss's meaning, breadth first
						3. Dawn of civilization 101 - agriculture created surplus food which allowed populations to have some non-farmer members, driving specialization.
						4. Specialization = experimentation, because unknown what value will be.
						5. Economic characteristics of science = high risk, not good activity in bad (resource - scarce) conditions, also documentation must survive.
						6. Specialization is the main feature of higher level entities. That is present also in the social contract tradition when the individuals ceded only some rights to the collective.
						7. K selection has a chance of having more spare resources, hence more settling on free spaces in the landscape (the spare energy to go over the fitness valley region). That is the same for humans in the evolutionary sense of the cost of bigger brains and for monopolies and Schumpeterian view that they have funds to do R&D. That is the advantage of an imperfect world. That is why we don’t see intelligent insects

That makes more resources per person ⇒ less competition, more specialization and experimentation. But this boost is half dead in the next generation, as low fertility becomes a cultural norm and support ratio goes back to pre boost levels.
						9. It’s more expensive (resource- intensive) to equip children to live; think college costs.
						10. Specialization decreases competition for some resources, think radiative expansion of mammals - not that many competitors for bamboo for pandas. Focusing on one niche leaves more resources in other niches.
						11. That means that if the new niche is very large, it can overshadow the original thing. Examples - how plant biomass is much larger than bacteria and other simple microorganisms - their niche tapped into the energy of the Sun, similarly with any common ancestor that died out, including early hominids, in history for example rise of many people from poverty during the last 200 years.

						14. Because of underdetermination thing, you can’t predict the future - there are important parts of the past that got lost and now you can’t predict the future - and that means also future income - you need to proof your economy both for unexpected new ones and scarcity of them
						15. Sharp divisions are cautionary, preventing free flows, such as freedmen doing no work 
						16. In most graphs of more than one variable, there are inevitable trade offs
					6. Surplus value is all consumed
						1. To generalize, it's the increase in efficiency of changing x into y, from energy cost z1 to z2. But the cost stays fixed as it was it's telos there, and there was no clear better way to use that.
						2. Also seen in - evolution (mammal higher energy efficiency over reptilians made them spread) - drive of wages towards subsistence and rate of profit to 0
						3. [@wrathofgnon on twitter> Same thing happened with high tech windows and triple glazing. "Wow, I can save twice as much energy on these windows! That means I can have at least twice as large windows as before!" (Narrator voice: the windows ended up having the curtains drawn 99% of the time anyway)](https://twitter.com/Solarchitects/status/1364221032769277952) 
					7. Trying out a couple of ways
						1. Usually state transitions try a few different modes before equilibrium, see English, French and Russian Revolution
						2. Protests happen if differences converge on one axis, producing an outburst stronger than the activation energy. 
							1. Activation energy to reach protest is low for the French
				3. Hold
					1. Golden Age
						1. What is about romantic novels / myth when heroes battle over a female character. That is when she makes a contest and for them to compete. That is the romantic, resource rich situation. In a resource scarce situation she’d just come to the stronger one of those who battle over something real. That resource plentiness is part of the appeal of that myth.
					2. Standardization
						1. Starts when the second derivative becomes negative
						2. [@PaulSkallas on twitter > Notice how different all the phones looked in the early years. Then In 2007 there was a extreme bottleneck: all the successive phones look alike now](https://twitter.com/PaulSkallas/status/1404417353149038594) 
						3. They freeze the levels of the assemblages below them.
						4. Law of habit: the more n level endures, the more efficient, automated and less-conscious / explicit are its workings (inter subn manipulations). What was in single places randomly, gets widespread, standardized, periodical.  For human enterprises, the longer explicitly defined systems work the more implicit following them becomes (eventually transcending the original definition).
							1. Examples: metric system, ISO standards, bullets, animal body shapes 
						5. The increasing mismatch and organizational decay of formalized institutions moves the decision power away from constrained and supervised institutions to epicentric institutions. Power is hard to contain.
						6. XS, mandatory mixes > Order is not uniformity (but non-random difference). As cries for mandatory homogenization are raised everywhere, discriminatory variation will need places to escape, to defend, and to hide.
					3. Hypercompetition
						1. [@acczibit on twitter> When people say "x used to be good but it sucks now" what they invariably mean, usually without being aware of it, is that x used to be good before zero-sum hypercompetition, but now that zero-sum hypercompetition has been introduced to it, x sucks](https://twitter.com/acczibit/status/1370891435432685570?s=19)
					4. Exhaustion of new angles
						1. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 408 > “The objective doctrines of Christianity had been already so firmly settled by the Councils of the Church, that neither the mediaeval nor any other philosophy could develop them further, except in the way of exalting them intellectually, so that they might be satisfactory as presenting the form of Thought.”
				4. Sink
					1. Accumulated wrongs
						1. Accumulating failures of science paradigm, say Newtonian physics at the dawn of 20th century
						2. In world history periods after the ‘pax’ one, say Athens around and after Socrates’ death,
						3. Efficiency of the direct layer needs to be > efficiency loss on the indirect layer
						4. Law of distance: the further two levels are, the less explicit communication is between them, it is by intermediaries.
					2. Always can fail
						1. Most memes fail, as most businesses fail, and most mutations are deleterious, some neutral, some negative. anyway you need a way to weed out inefficiencies
						2. Inefficiency of any configuration, also predictability, hence divination important
							1. Gives confidence in the abscence of possible certainity
							2. Randomizes
							3. Against bias
						3. When we talk about 'designing and maintaining human institutions', it's about an extremely complex systems, which even are not mappable / modelable because of observer effect
						4. You're designing a character for a game, but whatever you're optimize for, be it social justice, stability of the state, welfare, etc, it's too random to guarantee a good solution
						5. And that's just known unknowns, not UUs. it's like P != NP
						6. Let's say you aim for welfare + stability. Then you run this system for 500 years. At best you have 70% chance each century for it to 'work', which is about 17% chance of survival.
						7. Ultimately design & maintenance can only do so much. 
							1. Schmittian state of exception is one of the ways out
						8. That is, reduce the state transitions probability of reaching failure modes
						9. Ultimately every country, state, commonwealth has its fate in the hands of people who live in it, their spiritual condition / game theory behaviour
						10. Vide the 'regime hypothesis'
						11. This brings us back to Tolkien, and [“Saruman believes it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay. Small acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.” ― Peter JacksoGnon(https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4763879-saruman-believes-it-is-only-great-power-that-can-hold)
						12. What follows from here, apart from the obvious whitepill, which is an obligation at the same time?
						13. That every system will exhibit failure modes given enough time
						14. Failure modes of other systems might scare you from fixing your own system, or switching away from it
						15. This idea lowers your expectations to systems and people
						16. We should compare systems by mapping of failure modes, not availability heuristics concerning them
							1. E.g. NRx support of absolute monarchy is met with availability heuristic of tyranny, but comparison might be more favourable to it
						17. Rule: don't dismiss an idea just because you have a ready picture of how it fails. Maybe someone put this picture in you...
						18. Creating metanarratives means aiming at something more successful in some respect. That would entail a model of society, which we have from “class model”. Also, survival primacy below is decidedly connected to the equilibrium model - imaginative representation.
						19. 'Every Christian carries some cross' is about dealing with these imperfections
						20. In general the emotional form demanded by this failing is *faith*
					3. Bad allocation
						1. Downfall happens when value is overly directed into ephemeral, non-productive uses. The value multiplier falls down. That is neomohist, but the opposite is stagnation, when there is no extraction
					4. Bad endings
						1. Quote from Livy in G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 296 > “In our times we can neither endure our faults nor the means of correcting them.”
						2. When you overdose on S curves and oversaturation you hit flat spots and the output is killed
						3. Saturated system can afford / is forced into ‘weird’ transitions - qweronomics
							1. These transitions wouldn't appear out of bird eye 'rational' consideration (ie in the abscence of direct pressures) neither from a more blue ocean of competition in underdetermining environment (resource abundance and choice )
					5. Intelligence increases
						1. Bearish periods in a technology deter investors and speculators, but force people who have bought in to increase the real value from it
						2. Actually specialization in high energy condition isn't intelligent. It is intelligence that is forced to emerge under scarcity.
							1. Under abundance you maximize possible input, not the contents of the black box
						3. Empirically with mammals
							1. Mammals live in lower energy conditions than dinosaurs
							2. Mammals are more versatile
						4. Intelligence is generalization. Going into specialization you get dumber. Intelligence is created in materially catabolic conditions, in anabolic ones it goes by itself
						5. If a state of things was present because of 
							1. Different catabolic / anabolic factors
							2. Was directly leading to end after a few generations
							3. Can’t reason out of it
						6. What did Marx envision? Proletarian revolution soon(er or later). What Darwin did? A conditional. As complexity rises, there are more opportunities to save, and lower levels
						7. In the red phase it becomes more and more ‘just in time’, as value gets from organization, not the tech itself. As it already has been touched upon, the most basic prediction is that things are getting harder to predict.
					6. People accept decline
						1. [@anonynaut on twitter> a trap that conscientious people sometimes fall into is thinking that making local minima even worse will motivate people to escape and find a better situation than they'd otherwise be in in reality, most people will just accept the new minimum and suffer]( https://twitter.com/anonynaut/status/1454634160669302785)
						2. You need to keep the dimensions high
					7. Totalitarianism
						1. Analogy between totalitarian state wanting to govern all meme flows and full centrally directed economy - does not invent lines of flight; in both full control is impossible, but the same goes for total free way
						2. [Twitter user @jamespoulos> Overreach is typical of abruptly weakening powers. Contraction typically strengthens consolidation. In times of crisis people and institutions typically become caricatures of themselves.](https://twitter.com/jamespoulos/status/1394500503233572873) 
						3. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 223 >The abstract machine may be defined, for example, more geometrico, or under other conditions by an "axiomatic"; but the State apparatus is neither geometry nor axiomatics: it is only the assemblage of reterritorialization effectuating the overcoding machine within given limits and under given conditions. The most we can say is that the State apparatus trends increasingly to identify with the abstract machine it effectuates. This is where the notion of the totalitarian State becomes meaningful: a State becomes totalitarian when, instead of effectuating, within its own limits, the worldwide overcoding machine, it identifies with it, creating the conditions for "autarky," producing a reterritorialization by "closed vessel," in the artifice of the void (this is never an ideological operation, but rather an economic and political one).
				5. Warp
					1. Consequences of scale
						1. Distributed proximity
							1. Anime fans all over the world, in small cells, know most others from the community only online. That is, the same number of people forming a (sub)culture as for some village / island but now it is geographically remote.
							2. Principle of distributed proximity. Meaning that as progress and more size, the communities of similar thinking people will be more dispersed. 
							3. That brought me to considerations of how people need to be en masse to manufacture some type of action. 
							4. Local force, united force, protests / insurrections more dependent on communication infrastructure to work, that is functioning roads.
							5. Local dissipation of culture - geographically focused culture needs to quantitatively lose to these international communities.
							6. There is an inverse relationship of ICT and local force.
						2. Wells effect
							1. Small towns
								1. @Robinhanson on twitter > [What is best theory of why, relative to larger units, small towns are more conformist, & have a single integrated ruling class instead of 1D axis of conflict common in larger political units? I don't recall hearing anything on this when getting my Ph.D. in formal political theory](https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1462056224141324292) response from @flowidealism: > Up to about Dunbar squared, elites know each other personally or know someone who does. Relationship and reputation dynamics trump ideological factions. At scale + with fewer social interactions, ideological tribes + interest coalition > personal relationships and reputations.
							2. Increased egalitarianism
								1. Hierarchical society doubled in size from the local view (1 person, the Dunbar number of tulpas + stereotypes) is much more egalitarian, while the social structure is proportionally almost the same
							3. There is some escape velocity that you need to cross
							4. Concept space gets populated
							5. Defaults provided i
							6. N upbringing are broader, more total
							7. Does liberty make for more value making? Liberation from random quirks of people, like vassal systems? Then the value is saved better
							8. From Federalist Papers - can have layers of organizations, and differing choice mechanisms from most individual freedom
								1. Each does own (0)
								2. Liberum veto, unanimous
								3. Majority vote
								4. Minority - such as by lot
								5. One source (personal will, divine, etc)
							9. As power gots away from the formal ( random escape, later does not want to come back/ 
							10. University prestige, etc; does not keep up with population growth
							11. @Wrathofgnon on twitter [In 1570 a master turner in Munich made this wooden scale model of the city. At the time the city would have had about a population of 16 000 with a density similar to that of modern Seoul. No buildings over six floors, with most at two to four floors only. Plenty of green space.](https://twitter.com/wrathofgnon/status/1186129107408392194) 
								1. Real estate prices and economic make such stuff less feasible
							12. @Peter_Nimitz on twitter [Scale benefits the best of every area tremendously, but hollows out society. The beauty finds herself lacking to a far-away instagram model. The reformer find few care about the neighborhood - all eyes are on the capitol. The middle is crushed between the high & the low.](https://twitter.com/Peter_Nimitz/status/1359730770596646913) 
							13. @Dsdtzero on twitter [Lowest free fun principle.  LFFP. It’s an appropriately depressing acronym if you say it in an exasperated way. ](https://twitter.com/dsdtzero/status/1340419062220824576) 
							14. Specialization leads to concentration of power
							15. If you're in a highly specialized dead end / black hole, you can only push these resources into similarities
							16. Some relations in society are additive / subtractive, while population growth is multiplicative
								1. Layers grow faster - fixed human ability to conceive of hierarchies (biologically & culturally, best exemplified in the scale of China) - while the de facto layers multiply because of the scale, so the new layers must become hidden as cannot stay in the open - would not be subsumed into the brains
							17. Cultural Clash over morality and gender is inevitable - rise from small groups
							18. In a smaller scale, people go through states in life and at any point there is a limited number of people in that state, might not even know about each other
							19. As size grows, also does self-identification of transitory states as permanent, as more people are in it at the same time. through self-fulfilling prophecy that is instantiated
							20. As space gets filled up there are less entities with which to compare / compete so there is less benchmarks, less testing. That serves outcomes that are unorthodox from the point of view of a historicized thinker (but at that level cannot be orthodox outcomes); and there is no negative effect (of bandwagon) in the exploration space
							21. The graph of social views distribution gets flatter in the function of scale increase
								1. As the numbers rise (and especially when differences escalate), the social fabric gets more and more fragile; and more tolerance is needed for the same stability ceteris paribus
							22. When there are less aggregates, there is a smaller sample size and you cannot measure one feature against another ceteris paribus; just some features would be part of most models, some of very few. more of a case study area than statistics. The foremost example is our not having precedent for a planetary civilization
							23. Scale makes exceptions more integrated into the memeplex - miracles were more common in antiquity
							24. For a time low population prevented the specialization on the right level, so each person had a wide approach, prone to too easy general theories and fixed. quite like with general AI and the specialist systems. social work roles are necessarily differentiated, and deterministic on people’s view on politics. therefore cannot satisfy all of them. They also have conflicting views on what should be done and how far the interference should go. Choice of anyone cannot be ignored in democratic theory. Choice of those in power cannot be ignored in the realist / formalist theory. Two solutions - either give them voice or take away power. Unless shadow power takes place
							25. As populations rise, the minorities will have a pressure to congregate as then they feel more accepted and understood, easier networking, etc. So then there exist the enclave of the minority and not-yet joined members of the minority dissipated in the majority
								1. Majority judges these dissipated minority by similar stereotypes as those towards the ones in the enclave (more intercountry)
								2. The minority by congregating automatically becomes a recognizable outgroup for the majority (more intracountry); and that is irrevocable and inevitable
							26. Huge assemblages polarize things, creating less dimensions - tighter spaces to work in
						3. Other consequences
							1. That is different from deterritorialization. Deterritorialization as otherness of some meme, process specific to culture that makes it generated elsewhere, which changes attitude towards it and fosters [reterritorializatioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reterritorialization). The thing here, though similar, is an entirely different process. If I got confused, it was better to clarify anyway.
							2. So to shorten that, distributed proximity is a necessary consequence of increase in scale of population and communications (effective communicative population ECP, measure reflective of civilizational size / momentum). Culture creation is obviously under Nummogramatic scale effects. 
								1. Note: ECP would be quite different across time, especially if new comms tech was not invented concurrently with major changes in demographics - empirical question. What is more, interesting effects will happen on interstellar distances in civilizations given non-FTL universes.
							3. What is the impact of many hierarchies on total complexity? and lines of flight in science, technology and art.
								1. Fake hierarchies - deterritorialized hierarchies (like companies, games) 
								2. They multiply and weaken the societal will to power over each hierarchy (to some extent) - there is a feedback loop
								3. But these hierarchies do not contribute real value
								4. But that allows for differentiation of ambitious individuals into pro - system; and the remainder 
							4. The optics problem in treating something as transitory stage - war communism, transition via socialism - individually bi validity, as valid identity
								1. So that socialism would not be that valid identity
							5. Schools of thought coalesce and there are fewer thought leaders So they polarize, insofar as each political idiosyncrasy influences the environment Bubbles with obligatory stance on many issues Without that, no asabiyah
								1. [@doukhobour on twitter > The biggest threat to our survival is global convergence. Why 'harmonize' our policies? Why 'standardize' our institutional practices? Why 'reduce barriers' to capital and labor? We need borders. We need boundaries. We need experiments. If one fails, the collapse is contained.](https://twitter.com/doukhobour/status/1372840856336617474) 
							6. Generally the subjective rate of change possible to assemblage follows [Kleiber's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law). Instead of mass we put complexity, and the metabolic rate is capacity for change. A more complex and biologically spread out memeplex will take longer to update. 
							7. In the Jain 7 values, the growth in size means that more and more statements fall into the 7th category (does and does not exist and unassertible)
							8. The desire to be different scales quadratically[Skeuomorph - derivative object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) 
					2. Bypassing a desert
						1. Note that some nodes here are like a desert that you need to cross to conquer fruitful land. A desert which does not have a strategic significance besides leading to the other region. Therefore I haven't wasted words for building argument fortifications in those areas. On reaching the destination worthiness of the journey should be clear to the reader, being convinced by the final vision.
					3. New normalizations
						1. Possible transition = the radical behaviours get normalized like flagellation 
						2. Still stay in some small % of the population (stil flagellation much later)
						3. But the most of the population embraces these values, be it just for conformism
						4. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 104 >Two conjoined tendencies in so-called minor languages have often been noted: an impoverishment, a shedding of syntactical and lexical forms; but simultaneously a strange proliferation of shifting effects, a taste for overload and paraphrase. This applies to the German of Prague, Black English, and Quebecois.
						5. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 333 >Whenever a territorial assemblage is taken up by a movement that deterritorializes it (whether under so-called natural or artificial conditions), we say that a machine is released. That in fact is the distinction we would like to propose between machine and assemblage: a machine is like a set of cutting edges that insert themselves into the assemblage undergoing deterritorialization, and draw variations and mutations of it. For there are no mechanical effects; effects are always machinic, in other words, depend on a machine that is plugged into an assemblage and has been freed through deterritorialization. What we call machinic statements are machine effects that define consistency or enter matters of expression. Effects of this kind can be very diverse but are never symbolic or imaginary; they always have a real value of passage or relay.
					4. Undesire - antiproduction
						1. Your preferences 
							1. Are not chosen by you
							2. Are very random 
							3. Are not ‘reasonable’ or ‘perfect’
							4. Yet it’s useless to follow anything else unless through undesire
						2. Undesired - the process of embracing throwing under the bus value X while pursuing value Y. Mostly applied as a psychological trick, called discipline or sacrifice. What does this reflection serve? As any reflection, to strengthen the undesired 
							1. Hierarchy undesire in liberalism so that hierarchies are sold - beauty, etc - and kink 
							2. Ought implies can for law, metaphysics But not all our wants and desires
						3. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 235- 236 > The apparatus of antiproduction is no longer a transcendent instance that opposes production, limits it, or checks it; on the contrary, it insinuates itself everywhere in the productive machine and becomes firmly wedded to it in order to regulate its productivity and realize surplus value— which explains, for example, the difference between the despotic bureaucracy and the capitalist bureaucracy. This effusion from the apparatus of antiproduction is characteristic of the entire capitalist system; the capitalist effusion is that of antiproduction within production at all levels of the process. On the one hand, it alone is capable of realizing capitalism's supreme goal, which is to produce lack in the large aggregates, to introduce lack where there is always too much, by effecting the absorption of overabundant resources. On the other hand, it alone doubles the capital and the flow of knowledge with a capital and an equivalent flow of stupidity that also effects an absorption and a realization, and that ensures the integration of groups and individuals into the system. Not only lack amid overabundance, but stupidity in the midst of knowledge and science; it will be seen in particular how it is at the level of the State and the military that the most progressive sectors of scientific or technical knowledge combine with those feeble archaisms bearing the greatest burden of current functions.
						4. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 346-7 > Antiproduction effuses in the system: antiproduction is loved for itself, as is the way in which desire represses itself in the great capitalist aggregate. Repressing desire, not only for others but in oneself, being the cop for others and for oneself—that is what arouses, and it is not ideology, it is economy. Capitalism garners and possesses the force of the aim and the interest (power), but it feels a disinterested love for the absurd and non possessed force of the machine. Oh, to be sure, it is not for himself or his children that the capitalist works, but for the immortality of the system. A violence without purpose, a joy, a pure joy in feeling oneself a wheel in the machine, traversed by flows, broken by schizzes. Placing oneself in a position where one is thus traversed, broken, fucked by the socius, looking for the right place where, according to the aims and the interests assigned to us, one feels something moving that has neither an interest nor a purpose. A sort of art for art's sake in the libido, a taste for a job well done, each one in his own place, the banker, the cop, the soldier, the technocrat, the bureaucrat, and why not the worker, the trade-unionist. Desire is agape.
	8. This results in formation of Spirits which always have a valence of experience in a certain range. 
		1. Non-dead Spirits have cybernetic mechanisms by definition
		2. Experience of negativite feedback ( suffering) is present in all surviving cybernetic systems by definition. That is Dukha
		3. Dukha is limited to what the Spirit could have been through before. God is the Most Merciful
		4. Experience of positive feedback (pleasure / happiness) is present in all surviving cybernetic systems by definition. That is hedonic treadmill
		5. Extreme valences of experiences only occur when a Spirit leaves the environment that it was cybernetically trained in. Yet that is part of the higher - level training. 
	9. The evolution of the Universe is Chi - particles setting on different Li configurations. 
		1. Achieveing new emergent Li gives them access to higher dimensional spaces, with more resources
			1. Such as access to flight to get other fruit. New niches available to multicellular life compared to unicellular. Trench warfare and new war machines, competition on literal more fronts.
				1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 422 >However, in conformity with the essence, the nomads do not hold the secret: an "ideological," scientific, or artistic movement can be a potential war machine, to the precise extent to which it draws, in relation to aphylum, a plane of consistency,
				2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 360 > But the war machine's form of exteriority is such that it exists only in its own metamorphoses; it exists in an industrial innovation as well as in a technological invention, in a commercial circuit as well as in a religious creation, in all flows and currents that only secondarily allow themselves to be appropriated by the State.
		2. The supra-universe patterns of S curves create these dynamics:
			1. Blue oceans at the left side of the curve -
				1. New resource dimensions are found
				2. Less - crowded spaces
					1. Thousands of new forms blossom
				3. There is less competition for resources
				4. Sub assemblages are less optimized, more diverse
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 488 > what defines smooth space, then, is that it does not have a dimension higher than that which moves through it or is inscribed in it; in this sense it is a flat multiplicity, for example, a line that fills a plane without ceasing to be a line; (5) space and that which occupies space tend to become identified, to have the same power, in the anexact yet rigorous form of the numbering or non whole number (occupy without counting); (6) a smooth, amorphous space of this kind is constituted by an accumulation of proximities, and each accumulation defines a zone of indiscernibility proper to "becoming" (more than a line and less than a surface; less than a volume and more than a surface).
				5. There is free energy going around
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 315 > But this is true in a way altogether different from what psychoanalysis believes it to be. The decoded flows of desire form the free energy (libido) of the desiring-machines. The desiring-machines take form and train their sights along a tangent of deterritorialization that traverses the representative spheres, and that runs along the body without organs. Leaving, escaping, but while causing more escapes. The desiring-machines themselves are the fiows-schizzes or the breaks-flows that break and flow at the same time on the body without organs: not the gaping wound represented in castration, but the myriad little connections, disjunctions, and conjunctions by which every machine produces a flow in relation to another that breaks it, and breaks a flow that another produces.
				6. Is at the start of a new cybernetic loop
					1. You have limited time when the niche fills up 
				7. Less optimization, creating sacred waste - vide Bataille
					1. Waste creating the sacred https://twitter.com/ResistingMordor/status/1456806360679686148?t=ovfNqnM7-Q3aqNZy7qtKwg&s=09
				8. Escaping to a blue ocean is deterritorialization
					1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 73: it is by headlong flight that things progress and signs proliferate. Panic is creation.
					2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 54 > Deterritorialization must be thought of as a perfectly positive power that has degrees and thresholds (epistrata), is always relative, and has reterritorialization as its flipside or complement.
					3. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 331 > “Caesar effected two objects: he calmed the internal strife, and at the same time originated a new one outside the limits of the empire. For the conquest of the world had reached hitherto only to the circle of the Alps, but Caesar opened a new scene of achievement: he founded the theatre which was on the point of becoming the centre of History.” 
				9. [Autopoesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis) isn't sustained from within, it is enforced from without
				10. With complete saturation of red oceans new blue oceans are often discovered.
					1. Baudrillard THE ANIMALS: TERRITORY AND METAMORPHOSES > The whole discovery of the psychological, whose complexity can extend ad infinitum, comes from nothing but the impossibility of exploiting to death (the workers), of incarcerating to death (the detained), of fattening to death (the animals),  according to the strict law of equivalences:  so much caloric energy and time = so much work power such an infraction = such an  equivalent punishment so much food = optimal weight and industrial death.  Everything is blocked, so psychic life, the mental, neurosis, the psychosocial, etc. are  born, not at all in order to break this delirious equation, but to restore the principle of  mutually agreed upon equivalences.
					2. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 85 > The life of a people ripens a certain fruit; its activity aims at the complete manifestation of the principle which it embodies. But this fruit does not fall back into the bosom of the people that produced and matured it; on the  contrary, it becomes a poison-draught to it. That poison-draught it cannot let alone, for it has an insatiable thirst for it: the taste of the draught is its annihilation, though at the same time the rise of a new principle.
					3. (72-74) Mao On Contradiction > Contradiction exists in the process of development of all things, and ... in the process of development of each thing a movement of opposites exists from beginning to end.... There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist.... Contradiction is universal and absolute, it is present in the process of development of all things and permeates every process from beginning to end. 
					4. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 336 >What holds all the components together are transversals, and the transversal itself is only a component that has taken upon itself the specialized vector of deterritorialization. In effect, what holds an assemblage together is not the play of framing forms or linear causalities but, actually or potentially, its most deterritorialized component, a cutting edge of deterritorialization. An example is the refrain: it is more deterritorialized than the grass stem, but this does not preclude its being "determined," in other words, connected to biochemical and molecular components. The assemblage holds by its most deterritorialized component, but deterritorialized is not the same as indeterminate (the refrain may be narrowly connected to the presence of male hormones).
				11. This section uses many concepts from Deleuze & Guattari's Capitalism and Schizophrenia, see a quick summary
					1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 72-73 summary 
					2. > So the summary would have to be quick, the terminology would have to be set down as well as possible, for no good reason. There was a first group of notions: the Body without Organs or the destratified Plane of Consistency; the Matter of the Plane, that which occurs on the body or plane (singular, nonsegmented multiplicities composed of intensive continuums, emissions of particles-signs, conjunctions of flows); and the abstract Machine, or abstract Machines, insofar as they construct that body or draw that plane or "diagram" what occurs (lines of flight, or absolute deterritorializations). 
					3. > Then there was the system of the strata. On the intensive continuum, the strata fashion forms and form matters into substances. In combined emissions, they make the distinction between expressions and contents, units of expression and units of content, for example, signs and particles. In con-junctions, they separate flows, assigning them relative movements and diverse territorialities, relative deterritorializations and complementary reterritorializations. Thus the strata set up everywhere double articulations animated by movements: forms and substances of content and forms and substances of expression constituting segmentary multiplicities with relations that are determinable in every case. Such are the strata. Each stratum is a double articulation of content and expression, both of which are really distinct and in a state of reciprocal presupposition. Content and expression intermingle, and it is two-headed machinic assemblages that place their segments in relation. What varies from stratum to stratum is the nature of the real distinction between content and expression, the nature of the substances as formed matters, and the nature of the relative movements. We may make a summary distinction between three major types of real distinction: the real-formal distinction between orders of magnitude, with the establishment of a resonance of expression (induction); the real-real distinction between different subjects, with the establishment of a linearity of expression (transduction); and the real-essential distinction between different attributes or categories, with the establishment of a superlinearity of expression (translation). 
					4. > Each stratum serves as the substratum for another stratum. Each stratum has a unity of composition defined by its milieu, substantial elements, and formal traits (Ecumenon). But it divides into parastrata according to its irreducible forms and associated milieus, and into epistrata according to its layers of formed substances and intermediary milieus. Epistrata and parastrata must themselves be thought of as strata. A machinic assemblage is an interstratum insofar as it regulates the relations between strata, as well as the relations between contents and expressions on each stratum, in conformity with the preceding divisions. A single assemblage can borrow from different strata, and with a certain amount of apparent disorder; conversely, a stratum or element of a stratum can join others in functioning in a different assemblage. Finally, the machinic assemblage is a metastratum because it is also in touch with the plane of consistency and necessarily effectuates the abstract machine. The abstract machine exists enveloped in each stratum, whose Ecumenon or unity of composition it defines, and developed on the plane of consistency, whose destratification it performs (the Planomenon). Thus when the assemblages fit together the variables of a stratum as a function of its unity, they also bring about a specific effectuation of the abstract machine as it exists outside the strata. Machinic assemblages are simultaneously located at the intersection of the contents and expression on each stratum, and at the intersection of all of the strata with the plane of consistency. They rotate in all directions, like beacons.
			2. On the right hand side there are the red oceans
				1. Increasingly optimized, bug-like, converge on best body plans
					1. Insects with short lifespans are one of the best exmples of this, no experience, which is tied to decision making, only highly optimized automata with simple cybernetics
						1. > Animals that have “evolved” under intense competition are in some sense “stunted,” less beautiful, less intelligent, less magnificent. There are many “factions” in nature and many paths that pull in opposite directions. You must learn to see the secret language of nature and what it drives at: there is one path that drives for the production of a supreme specimen. It is the path that governs higher life; survival and reproduction are only side effects of this path. Life is at most basic, struggle for ownership of space BAM, part 1 chapter 13
					2. There are diminishing returns to any improvement
					3. [Peter principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peter-principle.asp) in full swing
					4. Unnecessary features are shedded, regressive forms appear ('devolution')
					5. Anything that might be used, is used, as in [Hyrum's law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/) 
					6. Just think of [consolidated markets](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/consolidated-industry.html)
					7. They are relative in a being-in-the-world sense
						1. A market can be consolidated for companies both on the insidide and outside
						2. But let's say a country is a red ocean (internal strife) and many parties invite mercenaries to increase own power. For those mercenaries that country is a blue ocean, full of opportunities. This picture fits the Late Roman Empire
				2. Monolithic to downright oppressive
					1. Ruling in hell rather than serving in heaven
						1. What's the 'ruling in hell' syndrome? > A shorthand for all the situations where maximizing personal/ingroup/whatever power incentivizes to downgrade net efficiency by suppressing others's ability. [as explained by twitter used EmojiPaGnon(https://twitter.com/EmojiPan/status/1432063857057574914)
					2. They are *for-itself*
						1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 315 > But this is true in a way altogether different from what psychoanalysis believes it to be. The decoded flows of desire form the free energy (libido) of the desiring-machines. The desiring-machines take form and train their sights along a tangent of deterritorialization that traverses the representative spheres, and that runs along the body without organs. Leaving, escaping, but while causing more escapes. The desiring-machines themselves are the fiows-schizzes or the breaks-flows that break and flow at the same time on the body without organs: not the gaping wound represented in castration, but the myriad little connections, disjunctions, and conjunctions by which every machine produces a flow in relation to another that breaks it, and breaks a flow that another produces.
				3. Resistant to change
				4. Can persist parastically on lower level assemblages past the time they produce new blue oceans
				5. Cybernetic loop increasingly present
				6. The subjective experiene of living under red ocean conditions isn't nice. Slums giving physical pressure or social norms mental pressure, such as [Weberian iron cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage) 
				7. Can die in various ways when approaching full population cap, for instance in [mutational meltdowGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutational_meltdown)
				8. They are the hells in which beauty is baked
					1. XS, hell baked > To the precise extent that we are spared, even for a moment, we degenerate — and this Iron Law applies to every dimension and scale of existence: phylogenetic and ontogenetic, individual, social, and institutional, genomic, cellular, organic, and cultural. There is no machinery extant, or even rigorously imaginable, that can sustain a single iota of attained value outside the forges of Hell.
				9. The opposition blue - red ocean corresponds to Deleuzian smooth vs striated space.
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 474 > Smooth space and striated space—nomad space and sedentary space—the space in which the war machine develops and the space instituted by the State apparatus—are not of the same nature. No sooner do we note a sim- ple opposition between the two kinds of space than we must indicate a much more complex difference by virtue of which the successive terms of the oppositions fail to coincide entirely.
					2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 486 > Nothing is ever done with: smooth space allows itself to be striated, and striated space reimparts a smooth space, with potentially very different values, scope, and signs. Perhaps we must say that all progress is made by and in striated space, but all becoming occurs in smooth space. Is it possible to give a very general mathematical definition of smooth spaces? Benoit Mandelbrot's "fractals" seem to be on that path. Fractals are aggregates whose number of dimensions is fractional rather than whole, or else whole but with continuous variation in direction.
				10. Late growth is Keynesian, fixing windows when someone throws bricks - secondary optimization, against the structure, not the reality itself. It's not absolute deterritorialization.
				11. Blue oceans have random violence, red oceans have systemic violence
				12. In a blue ocean you have to prove yourself against the Outside, in a red ocean instutionalized hierarchies, titles and credentials get popular, divorced from reality
					1. There's surely a type of neurotic human who hates risk and enjoys red oceans. Their existence is unavoidable without some mass empowerment / bravery increasing technology, yet their influence on the exploration / exploitation tradeoff choice correctness is often negative to say the least.
				13. Optimal amount of zero sum games is not zero - hell is good for baking 
				14. There are cache created - hysteresis of previous red oceans
					1. That is genetics and spinal catastrophism
					2. That is neurotic fear of past wrongs to repeat again
					3. Cleaning the cache is good
					4. Cleaning is done with diagonalization - deconstruction of dualistic ghosts
			3. Blue oceans can be black holes 
				1. There can be self-perpetuating blind ends into which you can fall. Places where the value drains into, vanishing into nothingness, creating nothing out of it. No, it's not the Joker burning his half of the money. Then he sent a message. The therm was coined by Deleuze and Guattari, saying that a line of flight might create a a black hole:
					1. > Another case is when deterritorialization becomes positive—in other words, when it prevails over the reterritorializations, which play only a secondary role—but nevertheless remains relative because the line of flight it draws is segmented, is divided into successive "proceedings," sinks into black holes, or even ends up in a generalized black hole (catastrophe). [ Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 508 ]
					2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,40 > Strata are Layers, Belts. They consist of giving form to matters, of imprisoning intensities or locking singularities into systems of resonance and redundancy, of producing upon the body of the earth molecules large and small and organizing them into molar aggregates. Strata are acts of capture, they are like "black holes" or occlusions striving to seize whatever comes within their reach. They operate by coding and territorialization upon the earth; they proceed simultaneously by code and by territoriality.The strata are judgments of God; stratification in general is the entire sys-tem of the judgment of God (but the earth, or the body without organs, con-stantly eludes that judgment, flees and becomes destratified, decoded,deterritorialized).
				2. From the absolute POV, black holes are assemblages whose expansion space will never rise in the [[sigmoid curve]]. Saturation never happens. [ Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) has more books than atoms in the Universe, so its creation is pure art, unreachable never filled blue ocean. Putting things into a black hole is an instance of [[Aesthetic as waste]]. 
				3. Relative black holes are those ones which you can't see the end yet
				4. From there we can say that the flows toward black holes indicate 'health' of an assemblage. One might go as far as to say that prescence of these flows *constitutes* the very notion of health of assemblages. Is a man healthy that only provides for himself and his material needs? [State of the arts is barometer of society](https://twitter.com/doxometrist/status/1449843090907439112).
				5. A sufficiently advanced civilization would read the End of science. Then everything would eventually be a clear black hole if localized in the universe [TK Birch Planet](https://spore.fandom.com/wiki/Fiction:Virgo_Birch_Planet). Otherwise there would be still plenty of uncertainity, for example in art.
				6. Examples of black holes
					1. - Absurdist (Camusian) hero is a black hole. To conquer lands, seduce lovers or create portayals as an actor are all endless endeavours
					2. - [Behavioral sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink) 
					3. - [Collectibles](https://twitter.com/mathOclock/status/1402496283768676353/photo/1) 
					4. [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) cuts close, it is a [Ratchet effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_effect) after all, but is more of a [[path dependance and limits to efficiency]] example, as saturation might be reached.
				7. How to get out of one
					1. It is [[Great Statesmen forge new lines of flight - Deleuze]] who lead the assemblage out of them.
					2. A degenerative ratchet can only progress, until it cannot go on, and it stops. What happens next is something else — its Outside. Moldbug calls it a reboot. History can tell us to expect it, but not what we are to expect. XS, the idea of neoreaction
					3. There are dangers in getting out of a black hole
						1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,229 > Why is the line of flight a war one risks coming back from defeated, destroyed, after having destroyed everything one could? This, precisely, is the fourth danger: the line of flight crossing the wall, getting out of the black holes, but instead of connecting with other lines and each time augmenting its valence, turning to destruction, abolition pure and simple, the passion of abolition. Like Kleist's line of flight, and the strange war he wages; like suicide, double sui-cide, a way out that turns the line of flight into a line of death.
					4. Lack of ways to channel the energy - scarcity of black holes, creates red oceans, 
						1. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 328 > “Ruin now broke in unchecked, and as there existed no generally recognized and absolutely essential object to which the country’s energy could be devoted, individualities and physical force were in the ascendant. “ 
				8. There are 2 types of blue oceans depending on the length of the S curve along the sigmoid access and our current derivative on it. There are climaxes (high derivative), plateaus (derivative close to 0)
					1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, introduction x > plateau is reached when circumstances combine to bring an activity to a pitch of intensity that is not automatically dissipated in a climax.
				9. Black holes can be made on purpose - that is the creation of lack , antiproduction
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 343 lack > There is no society that does not arrange lack in its midst, by variable means peculiar to it. (These means are not the same, for example, in a despotic type of society, or in a capitalist society where the market economy raises them to a degree of perfection unknown before capitalism.) This welding of desire to lack is precisely what gives desire collective and personal ends, goals or intentions—instead of desire taken in the real order of its production, which behaves as a molecular phenomenon devoid of any goal or intention.
			4. Periodicity in effciency
				1. Input efficiency of n+1 layer is the gain / effort ratio of acquisition of subn materials for n layer through n+1 means.
					1. All input dynamics have [the cake dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_theory) 
				2. Output efficiency is the efficiency of itnernal transformations
					1. Star's hydrostatic equilibrium is between the force of gravity = proportional to stellar mass, so fairly constant, and the force of thermal pressure from the reactions = proportional to the combustible material, hence decreasing in time
						1. > Humans form large coalitions better to compete against each other. Thus, as outgroup competition declines, ingroup competition increases. This is why nations need external enemies. Without them, they are torn apart from the inside. [twitter user Bo Winegard](https://twitter.com/EPoe187/status/1341837111490691074) 
						2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 502 > Summarily and traditionally, we distinguish three major strata: physicochemical, organic, and anthropomorphic (or "alloplastic"). Each stratum, or articulation, consists of coded milieus and formed substances. Forms and substances, codes and milieus are not really distinct. They are the abstract components of every articulation.
				3. Multicellular organisms arose from colonies of unicellular organisms, which had been sharing location for reasons of protection, or plain barriers to dispersal, eventually leading to nonzero benefits to specialization ( filtering, defense, storage - see sponges), and mutational force pushed some of them to the multicellular path. Then the organism no longer cared about invidiual cells
				4. The same process of specialization and perdition of individuals occured in humans
				5. The breakdowns of a system and associated loss of efficiency, state transitions are sometimes labeled [dragon kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_king_theory).
			5. We can try to make a specific diagram
				1. Coordinates could be
					1. A [grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram.) X - time, Y - space
					2. Inequality and ‘[size of cake’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_theory)
					3. Technology and class conflict
						1. Technology would be
							1. Production
							2. Distribution
							3. Communication
					4. Stability and justice
						1. What is just and what is lasting = the technology influences relations of these two. If sth is deemed unjust, it may fall despite being economically viable. (Just according to any, let’s say egalitarian conception of justice).
					5. [Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class), metanarrative, archetype
						1. Class would be 
							1. Lumpenproletariat
							2. Proletariat (reserve army of labour)
							3. Petite bourgeoisie (shrinking middle class)
							4. Owners of big capital
						2. Archetype would be
							1. Time
							2. Age
							3. Gender
					6. Power, beliefs and personality
					7. Population size
				2. Given a landscape, we can model society as having a momentum in some direction, metanarratives being force vectors
					1. You cannot change the coordinates by decree (the original graph)
					2. You cannot dictate the speed of change directly (first derivative)
					3. You can only accelerate / decelerate (second derivative) movement on some axes
				3. There can be various approaches to quantifying the landscape we're in
					1. Empirical approach - What would be needed is a factor analysis of all known historical data. On technology, urban development, health, etc.
					2. Constructing from existing theories as mentioned above; as these theories were also based on some observations, the data would be ‘second-handed’ of sorts.
				4. It would be interesting to do both and compare, empirical is beyond the scope here.
					1. [Cliodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliodynamics#:~:text=Cliodynamics%20(%2F%CB%8Ckli%CB%90,and%20analysis%20of%20historical%20databases.) might be the extant empirical approach to a similar task. Some differences lie in that they give less focus to beliefs, and on past trends leading to extrapolations. Thing described here is more about modeling hidden Markov states and mapping the whole potential state space.
				5. Outlining the theoretical one
					1. List places from a given theory (in a tuple: name - value on x axis - value on y axis-...), with axes specific to each of them 
					2. Standardize the axes as much as it it possible
					3. Try drawing paths, check for missing values, state transitions not mentioned in the theory
					4. Draw our historical path
					5. Notice how hypothetical states were defined in relation to contemporary state
					6. Work analogously from 5 to see yet undefined hypothetical states, from now 7.  list possible ‘close’ states from now  8.  extrapolate past trends, make scenarios
			6. Consequences of Oceans thinking - some are predictions, some further questions
				1. Limits for what would bring anarchy are society dependent, resilience is very much different. Like the ownership principle. If a society is heavily built around something if that drops there are no alternative solutions.
				2. We are confronted with a past path of ourselves and our ancestors
					1. From the 'static self' point of view, disavowing past deeds equals destruction of oneself. This is inflammatory topic, as an added precaution for those with [low decoupling](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7cAsBPGh98pGyrhz9/decoupling-vs-contextualising-norms), here's a [fictional example, SPOILERS for Star Wars:KOTOR2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NQhhuUavrQ)
					2. The past route might not comply with our current values
						1. There is argument to be made that even necessarily it will be different, the usual pattern being commiting sins on the path to ascendancy and erasing them later - history being written by the victors
							1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 180 > Biological formations and social formations are not formed in the same way in which they function.
						2. Crystal burning aliens - another fictional example of past path control
							1. Let’s imagine an alien race using crystals to get energy, but the process destroys them. They develop highly complex societies, think early 1900s futurism. Then they go into [solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk). They put crystals into solar panels. A new belief arises that destroying crystals is morally evil, because it hosts helpful spirits, and some even souls of preborn children. Then the path of the civilization through crystal - burning period would be heavily censored, even though the current status would not have been achieved without it. 
							2. Our aliens might say [‘Yes.’](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yes-chad-nordic-gamer?full=1) to the fact that it did use such a resource. Accept the path, but reject its current practice. That is particularism, opposite of common on our own planet universalism.
								1. Odo Marquard, In Praise of Polytheism > Philosophy has to be permitted to tell stories again, and of course to pay the price for that: the price of acknowledging and putting up with its own contingency. But here one already anticipates the cries of horror and the indignant warnings from the guild: that this means relativism—with the well-known paradoxes and fallacies that go with it—and is bound to end badly, or even end in skepticism. There was once a skeptic who heard these warnings and did not perceive them as objections

							3. Alternatively they might self-indulge in self-flagellation.
					3. To what extent can the course can be controlled? By what actors? [? move to navigatioGnon
						1. No party is omnipotent, that is sure
						2. Some changes require time
							1. There’s a reason for agents from a different age (medieval knight) to, after time travel, after initial shock of new society, they’d go ‘for the lowest impulses’ as they don’t have the mental infrastructure that makes us cope living in society
						3. Personality distribution is harder to change than income distribution 
							1. Well unless drugs are popularized
						4. Here again occurs the proactionary - procautionary dilemma. Don't trust my presentation to be unbiased, but that's not the point.
							1. For proactionary = The possibility of novel discoveries, see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_locomotion_in_living_systems#Evolutionary_constraints) on animals with wheels.
							2. Here procautionary = cannot be quite certain why [what is working is working.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_and_latent_functions_and_dysfunctions) [ Chesterton’s fence] Our past movements on this map might have been influenced by what we do not know. Maybe possibly even cannot ever know due to lost records. The ‘our path’ in the ‘past section’ is not fully knowable. We might be avoiding something eldritch by going through something we see as the worst thing now. [? this again relates to navigation and size of the space]
								1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 431 > Can it at least be said that the hunter-gatherers are the "true" primitives and remain in spite of it all the basis or minimal presupposition of the State formation, however far back in time we place it? This point of view can be maintained only at the price of a very inadequate conception of causality. And it is true that the human sciences, with their materialist, evolutionary, and even dialectical schemas, lag behind the richness and complexity of causal relations in physics, or even in biology. Physics and biology present us with reverse causalities that are without finality but testify nonetheless to an action of the future on the present, or of the present on the past, for example, the convergent wave and the anticipated potential, which imply an inversion of time. More than breaks or zigzags, it is these reverse causal- ities that shatter evolution. Similarly, in the present context, it is not ade- quate to say that the Neolithic or even Paleolithic State, once it appeared, reacted back on the surrounding world of the hunter-gatherers; it was already acting before it appeared, as the actual limit these primitive socie- ties warded off, or as the point toward which they converged but could not reach without self-destructing. These societies simultaneously have vectors moving in the direction of the State, mechanisms warding it off, and a ties warded off, or as the point toward which they converged but could not point of convergence that is repelled, set outside, as fast as it is approached. To ward off is also to anticipate.
						5. Cybernetic systems are never in static, but in dynamic equibliria - that is the Rhythm Principle
							1. Be it prey-predator numbers
							2. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 313 > The milieus are open to chaos, which threatens them with exhaustion or intrusion. Rhythm is the milieus' answer to chaos. What chaos and rhythm have in common is the in-between—between two milieus, rhythm-chaos or the chaosmos: "Between night and day, between that which is constructed and that which grows naturally, between muta- tions from the inorganic to the organic, from plant to animal, from animal to humankind, yet without this series constituting a progression ..." In this in-between, chaos becomes rhythm, not inexorably, but it has a chance to. Chaos is not the opposite of rhythm, but the milieu of all milieus. There is rhythm whenever there is a transcoded passage from one milieu to another, a communication of milieus, coordination between heterogene- ous space-times. Drying up, death, intrusion have rhythm.
							3. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 358 > Even in bands of animals, leadership is a complex mechanism that does not act to promote the strongest but rather inhibits the installation of stable powers, in favor of a fabric of immanent relations. One could just as easily compare the form high-society life to the form "sociability" among the most highly evolved men and women: high-society groups are similar to gangs and operate by the diffusion of prestige rather than by reference to centers of power, as in social groupings (Proust clearly showed this noncorrespondence of high-society values and social values). Eugene Sue, a man of high society and a dandy, whom legitimists reproached for frequenting the Orleans family, used to say: "I'm not on the side of the family, I side with the pack." Packs, bands, are groups of the rhizome type, as opposed to the arborescent type that centers around organs of power.
							4. XS, freedom - prelude 1a > Where I think Bryce’s account is still deficient is most easily shown by a further specification of his principal point. Equilibrium is the telos of those particular dynamic complex systems governed by homeostasis, which is to say: by a dominating negative feedback mechanism. Such systems are, indeed, in profound accordance with classical Aristotelian physical teleology, and its tendency to a state of rest. This ancient physics, derided by the enlightenment mechanists in the name of the conservation of momentum, is redeemed through abstraction into the modern conception of equilibrium. ‘Rest’ is not immobility, but entropy maximization.
						6. See [this presentatioGnon(https://slideplayer.com/slide/12668416/) for some of the pitfalls
						7. Total restriction is easier to start and see something that looks like results than incentivizing growth in the direction you want, yet it might bite you later
							1. Gilles Deulze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 197 > Even where When Etienne Balazs asks why capitalism wasn't born in China in the thirteenth century, when all the necessary scientific and technical conditions nevertheless seemed to be present, the answer lies in the State, which closed the mines as soon as the reserves of metal were judged sufficient, and which retained a monopoly or a narrow control over commerce (the merchant as functionary).
					4. Metanarratives are just another wheels in the assemblage machine. 
						1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,366 Asabiyah >A body {corps) is not reducible to an organism, any more than esprit de corps is reducible to the soul of an organism. Spirit is not better, but it is volatile, whereas the soul is weighted, a center of gravity. Must we invoke a military origin of the collective body and esprit de corps? "Military" is not the part that counts, but rather the distant nomadic origin. Ibn Khaldun defines the nomad war machine by: families or lineages PLUS esprit de corps. The war machine entertains a relation to families that is very differ- ent from its relation to the State. In the war machine, the family is a band vector instead of a fundamental cell; a genealogy is transferred from one family to another according to the aptitude of a given family at a given time to realize the maximum of "agnatic solidarity." Here, it is not the public eminence of a family that determines its place in a State organism but the reverse; it is the secret power (puissance), or strength of solidarity, and the corresponding genealogical mobility that determine its eminence in a war body. This has to do neither with the monopoly of an organic power (pouvoir) nor with local representation, but is related to the potential (puis- sance) of a vortical body in a nomad space. Of course, the great bodies of a modern State can hardly be thought of as Arab tribes.
			7. What the oceans are not, and comparison to related terms
				1. Big History and singularity - secular mythologization of the physical - energetic processes
					1. Big Bang 
					2. Stars 		
					3. Heavier elements 
					4. Planets 
					5. Origin and evolution of life 
					6. Human species development 	
					7. Agriculture
					8. Industrial 		
					9. Technological singularity (possibly)		
				2. Cliodynamics - already mentioned 2.4.8.3.4
				3. Organicism as in Italian fascism - here oceans don't priviledge the state / nation level
				4. [Iron law of oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy) says that a Rousseauan democracy will degenerate into partisanship and more and more centralized decision making - that corresponds to blue - red ocean transition
					1. Collective decision making leading to good outcomes such as the 'wisdom of the crowd' problem only works if the crowd is truly random. Doesn't work for a mob or a human marinade of stale centralized television.
					2. In a similar way, for red ocean embeddings for human societies (high scarcity environments), an outcome from 1984's *The Book*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Oligarchical_Collectivism)’) of tripartite structure will be true.
				5. [Spiral dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics) is not far off from what is suggested here
					1. What he gets right
						1. - the mechanisms of helping people in the end - the easiest thing to do, it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy
						2. ‘Man now faces most difficult transition’ - that is hero mongering, creating film-like story
					2. What he gets wrong
						1. Spooks of ‘becoming truly human’
						2. Hopelessly fetishizes the eschaton (see his last stage, number 8), giving people hope. Published in 1974, since ‘momentous leap’ did not happen.
						3. Hegelian - like attributing spirit to whole nation
						4. His theory was not a winning meme
				6. Marxist ['quantity into quality'](https://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12926 is the change of the blue oceans
			8. We can easily imagine the movement of a society on possiblity landscape as a flock of shep
				1. Imagine a herd of sheep guarded by hounds. Outside there are dangers - cliffs, hard rocks, mud, even some wolves. Around them there are several hounds which guard the herd against the wolves. The sheep behave each by own ‘programming’, with different response time and intensity. Each manoeuvres its position in relation to variables such as distance from hounds, grass density gradient, position of the rest of the herd. The whole machine of several dozen sheep and a handful of hounds, must continuously move, because grass depletes. 
				2. We may make some predictions depending on the structure of the group. A relatively homogeneous population of sheep (similar algorithms), would diminish the number of hounds necessary. Nevertheless, there always should be more than one hound if the terrain is complex.
				3. Of course, the machine represents a society, where sheep are we all, and hounds are the media, authorities, etc. This model may sound deterministic, but it is made to describe social aggregative phenomena, which are by their nature tribal, emotional and involuntary.
				4. Another metaphor is of a mercury - like liquid on a violent surface. Narratives could be the points determining its place, surface tension would mean the society sticking together. Note that in this one it is the surface that changes, society is more as passive.
				5. This could be used to illustrate historical and hypothetical shifts in society. Many (in theory all) relations already present in literature could be made to fit the model. After all, they were inspiration for the model in the first place.  Axes, relations between places might be extracted from criticisms, relations between ideas such as:
					1. Alt-right thinkers rejection of egalitarianism = similar wealth coordinates as unsustainable
					2. Marxist rejection of utopian socialism = presence of a period of open class war, therefore a valley on prosperity (?) axis before plains of peaceful prosperity after communism is established
					3. [High level equilibrium trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_equilibrium_trap) = local maximum on prosperity
					4. Libertarian idea of freedom as source of wealth, all government intervention as decreasing = movements on the government intervention axis being a downward slope towards lesser prosperity
					5. Conservative tendency to slow the movement = they want to go on plains, where are no drastic changes
					6. Progressive views on [crime statistics](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_the_surprising_decline_in_violence/transcript?language=en), etc. = in our historical
					7. Reactionary [cycle](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8751435-hard-times-create-strong-men-strong-men-create-good-times) , [theory of cyclical rise and fall of civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bagot_Glubb#Writings) 
					8. Neo-lemurian [Numogram](http://www.ccru.net/syzygy.htm) quasi-cyclicality, etc (all cyclical ideas) = pattern in time that societies go around some places
					9. Accelerationism = finding the highest cliff and jumping 
				6. A society might generally go in some direction, and have many aspects of it covered, while leaving others be. Let’s say a Communist party having nationalized some but not all industries. Then some specific issue is left out, that is right. We can either put all issues on separate axes, or (as was implicitly assumed above), take some average trend and only that include on the graph. In the first case we lose some of the ability to call the aggregate of issues in one quick word. And having separate axis for every issue would be less human readable, as we are restricted to 4 dimensions (duh).
			9.  These dynamics are as inescapable as cybernetic circuits of individual beigns
				1. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 41 > The History of the World is not the theatre of happiness. Periods of happiness are blank pages in it, for they are periods of harmony — periods when the antithesis is in abeyance. 
		3. Meta-cybernetic game of assemblage level n is between assemblages n+1 wanting to optimize n, and assemblages from the levels n-1 trying to escape shackles optimization. N is path dependent on its constituent parts in a path dependance, spinal catastrophism way.
			1. This dynamic is like a start balancing the gravity and the force of nuclear reactions inside it to keep its size, until gravity prevails
			2. Cancer is n-1 rebellion
			3. Gnon puts limits on scope of both
			4. Path dependance from the past red oceans is the result of the exploration behaviour of oceans, leading to locally correct assemblages (upaya). 
				1. That is the blind idiot god Azathoth
		4. These dimensions are not hierarchical, and new dimensions need not to be spatially larger
			1. Microconductors were not as small back then as now
		5. There is no sharp line between the two
		6. Life in the Universe is the experience of cybernetic highs and lows in the landscape of changing red and blue oceans. 
			1. Red oceans are generators of persistence level - reproduction, satisfaction of biological needs, rudimentary positive valence to keep going. Everything having a Telos
			2. Blue ocean is the generator of surplus value - beauty, art, ecstasy, games without goals.
			3. Everything we humans value is from blue oceans
				1. Did blue oceans write this Minecraft game?
			4. The Universe not having a Telos is a blue ocean
				1. “_only_ as an _aesthetic phenomenon are_ existence and the world _justified_” (38) - Nietzsche, Birth of Tragedy
				2. It’s like routine flaring of oil [Routine flaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routine_flaring) 
				3. And whenever Gnon's emergent law limit is hit, that is the red ocean creeping back
			5. There are two types of overflow
				1. Primary overflow = first happiness = Eden, from overpresence
				2. Secondary overflow = second happiness = when overflow from creation is larger than expected yet still within short term limits of social / personal
			6. There are two types of fragility - path dependency - dependance on the constraints of previous choices - you grow and encounter a red ocean and degenerative ratchet - continued expansion into a blue ocean without returns. 
				1. Sexuality has both
				2. Ultimately ratchet converges at path dependency,
		7. Numogramatically the oceans are related to the flows thus:
			1. Plex - the maternal basis of a given assemblage. All the sub assemblages. 
			2. Rise - the new market, the niche, new Chi thanks to new Li. By the means of emergent laws, such and such plex assemblage configuration was proven blessed by Gnon: 'go forth and multiply'. 
			3. Hold - what happens on successful establishment of cybernetic feedback on the new complexity level. 
				1. Not yet achieved by the Terran assemblage in early 21st century. Technology and higher populations opened new dimensions which are far from optimized into a stable configuration
				2. 
			4. Sink - emergent patterns in the loop send the assemblage crashing down. Don't worry, we're still flying the remaining subassemblages to Plex, where they are recycled. 
				1. The harder transgression against Gnon, the less survivors there are and the more is the ecosystem crippled
				2. You get totalitarian effects of the reddening ocean
				3. That is also the pattern of hope and renewal. Sometimes to get from A to B you need to physically destroy what keeps you in A and build your vehicle to B
					1. Sea peoples
			5. Warp - now the sygzygies so far, the main time-circuit all become the Plex for another blue ocean, becoming a red ocean on its own.
		8. The ergodicity of ocean change gives rise to cycles
		9. Prediction capabilities are capped
			1. For an agent A and environment E of complexity CE there is a limit on predictability p of E by A given by informational capacity of A. For example limited at 30%. That must be true for tribal societies. Sometimes the state of art is poor AF. 
			2. Human groups have a decision making process dependent not on individual intelligence, but social emotional intelligence. Therefore the predictability can be very low. 
			3. How to feed information to the social machine to be more correct? But does it make predictions? Can a democratic society be rational? What kind of society can be rational?
			4. Same restrictions apply to degreebling - [[Limited speed of examinatioGnon]
				1. [First link](https://twitter.com/pee_zombie/status/1391565187719761930?s=19)

				3. [The universe is greebling](https://antlerboy.medium.com/the-universe-is-greebling-b89c3ac5269f)
			5. There can be various emergent limits on possible predictions in agiven space
				1. Assumping 'scientific method' to mean observation, hypothesis, experiment, evaluation
					1. And each of the 4 is a different spqr construct
				2. Universe might limit it in various ways, at different steps - being born in a dying stage, or on a water planet 
			6. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 20-21 > Each period is involved in such peculiar circumstances, exhibits a condition of things so strictly idiosyncratic, that its conduct must be regulated by considerations connected with itself, and itself alone.
			7. [Lenin, Summary of Dialectics (1914)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/quotes.htm) > Human knowledge is not (or does not follow) a straight line, but a curve, which endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment, section of this curve can be transformed (transformed one-sidedly) into an independent, complete, straight line, which then (if one does not see the wood for the trees) leads into the quagmire, into clerical obscurantism (where it is anchored by the class interests of the ruling classes).
3. Oceans are something on which *navigare necesse est*. How to approach navigation?
	10. There must be some optimal routes
		1. Basically other processes that we know from evolution which were already applied to metanarratives in chapter 3.
		2. Some pendulum-like movements can be expected, as in the [original link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape#In_evolutionary_optimization). This would fall in line with the ‘cyclical’ movements mentioned above.
		3. What follows from the map-like structure of possible states of society is that:
			1. The Way as important as the goal. 
			2. Think the terms such as [Logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_et_veritas_et_vita#:~:text=In%20the%20Latin%20Vulgate%2C%20verse,to%20describe%20the%20early%20church.), [DaGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao), [eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) in the ‘focus on the process, not the goal’ meaning (not as a descriptive rule of the Universe). 
			3. To get to a new state you need to choose the states along the way carefully. Some might be more risky. 
			4. A way to high region of prosperity axis might lead through an uncertain rope bridge. 
		4. What we want ( utopias) + current state = what is
			1. What is possible given world, humanity, current state of resources
			2. What we might actually implement
			3. Never post scarcity
		5. Even a revolution, ‘starting from scratch’ must incorporate some cultural elements from the ancien regime; you can only break away so far
	11. Being an observer already changes the observed state	
			1. There are equilibria once cognized, already put on on one side of them
				1. A consequence of web natrue 
				2. AntiOedipus: ‘We must conclude that, strictly speaking, incest does not and cannot exist. We are always on this side of incest, in a series of intensities that is ignorant of discernible persons; or else beyond incest, in an extension that recognizes them, that constitutes them, but that does not constitute them without  rendering them impossible as sexual partners.’ 
				3. Ad Evola and notions of dualism that can only be realized on one side, that is the historical - mythological distinction
				4. The idea of equilibrium that once you see it, you are already on one part of which - the basic conservative idea
	12. The egoist - anarch axis (Stirner vs Junger) is diagonalized by the realization that an arbitrary choice of a real Spirit to serve is not possible
			1. By Spirit, you will always serve Gnon, of which you are part of
			2. You can choose a different Spirit ( change companies, armies), but trivially you always work for many
				1. Why does this sound like Tzeentch?
			3. Therefore the selection is purely tulpamantic. That is not to say it doesn't have feedback effect on the Spirit. That's what self-affirmations are, after all
	13. In the same way we can discard the following views: Stirnerian 'all property is owned justly, even if it was stolen, because the thief deserves it by the force of keeping it', wu-wei as a Daoist all-precept, zero-summing, Leibniz 'best of possible worlds', and Jesus's 'who is without fault let him throw the first stone' Are stoicism acceptance and Nietzschena eternal return good too? maybe accepting world as it is, aesthetic pheomenon?
			1. All these views reject all intermediary assemblages between the speaker and the Ultimate
			2. One of the assemblages rejected is part of them themselves - the fact that we are the Universe. Our jury is no worse than others. We embody the Souls of the working memes.
			3. It is a rejection of life as struggle of cybernetic loops. It is turning off your loop. Still loops higher up and lower down work their way, leaving you alone. They don't care.
			4. > The insight then to which — in contradistinction from those ideals — philosophy is to lead us, is, that the real world is as it ought to be — that the truly good — the universal divine reason — is not a mere abstraction, but a vital principle capable of realizing itself. This Good, this Reason, in its most concrete form, is God. Hegel, philosophy of history 51
	14. Basic heuristics include
		1. Exploration - exploitation algorithms - respecting Gnon's existing patterns and re-negotiating the terms of cooperation in exchange
		2. The work heuristic
				1. Be humble towards Gnon
				2. Don't create surplus without directing it - to be in control, the final product must go to the Outside
			1. Work - create that surplus
		3. There are fixations on one level (Comte's religion of humanity, Elua), potentially expanding a current blue ocean. Yet they are hard to calibrate and fall into red ocean state sooner or later
	15. There are boundary conditions
		1. Main challenges
			1. Gnon exists, that is undoubted, the only question is whether Elua is truly possible 
			2. It's graph of complexity vs closeness to Gnon, it needs to have correct shape
				1. For armchair reactionaries and rural isolated conservatives both the civilization / society and living creatures / individuals have quite small possiblity space, and directions there are simple
				2. For starry eyed progressives, druggy hippies, human experience is vast and diverse, with lots of to try out, and lots to appreciate
			3. The prime task is to size up the possibility space
				1. What types of spaces
					1. How to recognize each
					2. How to balance exploration and exploitation
				2. The landscape of possible confiuratinos is like Library of Babel, so there is no ergodicity!
				3. Vastness of the possibility space mean less attachment to starting conditions - also less universalism, perennialism - it’s a direct argument against it
				4. 10^10^77 possible unique states for the Universe, mentioned [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pld8wTa16Jk) 
				5. Convergence has happened for many other spaces than government [here a biological account](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13194-012-0047-9)
				6. Yet on the side of the 'big space, '[weird relations between animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9KvEg102Tc) remind us of the realm of possiblity. These are very leftist.
				7. We know in the past the world was taken to be decreasing, implying a decrease in diversity-> number of combinations -> possiblity space
				8. The better you think some solution was optimized at some point, the more specific it is for circumstances then. with a big possibility space its fitting back then means it's less good now - it's a tradeoff. Unless we posit a limit to wellness, a ceiling that is reached in general time, and in the 'best period', it just isn't obstructed that much?
					1. Persistence of creationism either hints at human incapability of thinking in big possiblity spaces or American Protestant singlemindedness
				9. Also the size of the space - reactionaries see it as quite small. then the doomsday paradox works whether where maxima are
				10. If millions of possible DNA  → leftist, progressvie, deterritorialization
				11. But the emergent forms might still take on a smaller number of forms. Possiblity space might be larger on a smaller spatial dimension, yet pressures on the higher level still reduce their number. That is Gnon. The limit on the emergent. [# LIFE BEYOND II: The Museum of Alien Life (4K)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI)
				12. Complexity vs energy ratio as a Gnon-imposed limit on the Universe
				13. Really Gnon is the constraints on landscape, with its younger sibling - impossible transitions though possible to see other regions
				14. The fact that the bubble is dual means that there are physical options not accessible to us in that the pragmatic path would lead via physically impossible terrain 
				15. Philosopher's dream
					1. Limited spread of the level 
						1. @Parafactual on twitter > [i find it very hard to believe most people can't understand selection bias](https://twitter.com/parafactual/status/1462211726284185603)
					2. Idealized condition for humanity, utopia where every person has a sage status; that is has had reconciled all possible beliefs and assigned epistemic status (in a Boolean scheme or any other logic)
					3. Since on individual level truth and spreading do not correlate perfectly, neither they ever will on social level - if no game theory catastrophes preclude the attainment of that.
						1. Odo Marquard, In Praise of Polytheism > The truth is one thing, and how we can live with the truth is another. Knowledge serves the former, cognitively, and stories serve the latter, vitally.
				16. 2 interpretations of similarity
					1. High ergodicity - we've explored all o fit, so arose independently
					2. Low ergodicity - the similarities are cladistic, not emergent
				17. In various meta-ecosytems these are different
				18. This depends on mutation cost and spreading cost
					1. Finding out a sunken fleet of goods between ancient countries increases the prior for low ergodicity
					2. Finding out aliens are commies is for high ergodicity
				19. Some say it's all about unbearable present and great future. That misses the question about what is possible
					1. Page 23, Maps of meaning, Jordan B Peterson - > To get somewhere in the future presupposes being somewhere in the present; furthermore, the desirability of the place travelled to depends on the valence of the place vacated. The question of “what should be?” (what line should be travelled?) therefore has contained within it, so to speak, three subqueries, which might be formulated as follows: 1) what is? – what is the nature (meaning, the significance) of the current state of experience? 2) what should be? – to what (desirable, valuable) end should that state be moving? 3) how should we therefore act? – what is the nature of the specific processes by which the present state might be transformed into that which is desired? There appears to exist some “natural” or even – dare it be said – some “absolute” constraints on the manner in which human beings may act as individuals and in society. Some moral presuppositions and theories are wrong; human nature is not infinitely malleable.
				20. There's lot of spacetime out there - an argument for the 'big space' leftist (!) POV
					1. XS, timescales > Planck-length (in a vacuum), approximately 5.4 x 10 -44 seconds. This is not a number readily intuited. A comparison to the (mere) 4.3 x 10 17 seconds that have so far lapsed during the entire history of the universe perhaps provides some vague sense. (Anthropomorphic time-scale bias is at least roughly as blinding to minuscule durations as to enormous ones.)
					2. XS, timescales > The upper limits of the cosmic time-scale are harder to identify. Speculative cosmological models predict the evolution of the Universe out to 10 60 years or more, when the last of the black holes have evaporated. The Stelliferous Era (in which new stars are born) is expected to last for only 100 trillion (10 14) years, out to approximately 7,000 times the present age of the universe. (If the stelliferous universe were analogized to a human being with a one-century life-expectancy, it would presently be an infant, just entering its sixth post-natal day, with 987 billion years to wait until its anthropomorphic first birthday).
				21. The first problem is defining the landscape. And it is the last problem, in fact. Because choosing the way in the landscape is determined by the landscape. Not necessarily, you would choose the optimized value. You always optimize some. Lack of decision would also be a decision
				22. Convergent evolution - there are fascinating example from biology here - [List of examples of convergent evolution - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_examples_of_convergent_evolution#Prehistoric_reptiles)
			4. There are various ways to react to the topology of the space
				1. See [Condorcet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem) that probability of individual correct choice is more than 1/2 then the aggregate converges to 1, if lower than to 0 = so a very discrete  
				2. If it's a *sink* and space is low, you want to go back. If space is large, go elsewhere
				3. In a sufficiently multidimensional world it's harder to spot patterns. Or maybe more fake ones? 
					1. [Vitalik's article on convex vs concave](https://hackernoon.com/is-your-perspective-convex-or-concave) mindset acknowledges high dimesionality of the world, giving example of AI research
				4. What matters in the topology is: number of dimensions, size of dimensions, and shape
				5. If the space is small you want 
					1. To commit less to exploration
					2. Be ready to phase out exploration focused assemblages - if they overgrow, it's cancerous, 
				6. The danger of exploration overcommitment
				7. SSC's famous [*Meditations on Moloch*](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) cover this topic
					1. He says that reactionaries see traditions - Gods-of-Earth (our local cybernetic patterns) as good, while them being-local isn't good enough. That these are not the outermost loops, ergo susceptible to external changes - there are Outer Gods that are foreign
						1. > When the veil is lifted, Gnon-aka-the-GotCHa-aka-the-Gods-of-Earth turn out to be Moloch-aka-the-Outer-Gods. Submitting to them doesn’t make you “free”, there’s no spontaneous order, any gifts they have given you are an unlikely and contingent output of a blind idiot process whose next iteration will just as happily destroy you.
						2. He sees the outermost circuits as destructive to us. That is simply untrue
							1. I am a transhumanist and I really do want to rule the universe.
								1. > I am a transhumanist and I really do want to rule the universe. [...] [But] the current rulers of the universe – call them what you want, Moloch, Gnon, whatever – want us dead, and with us everything we value. Art, science, love, philosophy, consciousness itself, the entire bundle. And since I’m not down with that plan, I think defeating them and taking their place is a pretty high priority.
							2. This universe, the outermost loop, doesn't have enough selective pressure, suppression, nor enough low dimensionality to destroy all of these
							3. Gnon is Most Merciful
							4. Gnon is inside you. Any system mediating between your (? the *self* problem) and Ultimate Reality, would need to be cybernetically sound in an unprecedented way - [daemon-free](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nyCHnY7T5PHPLjxmN/open-question-are-minimal-circuits-daemon-free). And in a different way, you're part of Moloch - Gnon nonduality
						3. [Mai La Dreapta](http://mailadreapta.wordpress.com/) said in a comment
							1. > what you really need to wonder is whether God is Moloch or Elua. Because if God is Moloch, you’re _screwed_. Your FAI project will fail. Your resources will run out. Your children will disavow your. Your values will perish. There is no way out.
						4. And later
							1. > the stories of the Great Flood and the Tower of Babel as parables of the fact that God/Gnon/Moloch is _really, really_ hard to beat, as you are quite literally playing by his rules, in his court, and under his supervision. 
				8. There's also the [prometheian approach]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YwW9dKLlPQ )
					1. They say here that traditionalism and accelerationist futurism
						1. Mussolini vs Marinetti
						2. Traditionalists vs Landians
					2. Guenon's usage of a *tradition* which is *counter-traditional*, as opposed to modernist *anti-traditional*''
					3. That prometheanism by nature innovates, rebels against the gods
					4. Prometheanism is wrong about
						1. Total rebellion, as opposed to exchange
						2. Humanism, not [anegoicity](https://twitter.com/Outsideness/status/1497757697730482179)
				9. Similar tone is in Fromm's Escape from Freedom, page 234
					1. > “The victory of freedom is possible only if democracy develops into a society in which the individual, his growth and happiness, is the aim and purpose of culture, in which life does not need any justification in success or anything else, and in which the individual is not subordinated to or manipulated by any power outside himself, be it the State or the economic machine; finally, a society in which his conscience and ideals are not the internalization of external demands, but are really his and express the aims that result from the peculiarity of his self.”
			5. And there are speed concerns
				1. [Wasserstein metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric) to move stuff from one configuration to another
				2. Ocean diagram and the length of your vector - now that the change is faster you get more momentum and can change more [Epistemological rupture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_rupture) 
				3. Momentum really counts - speed of change in 20th century  was connected to lack of social resistance from older demographics as the demographic explosion created unique potential
		2. Agents and law
			1. Each agent has limited number of possible actions
				1. Controlled and non-controlled variables 
					1. Non-controlled: time and Gnon
					2. For a given agent
						1. Configuring internal flows - quality
						2. Increasing inflows - quantity
						3. NO increasing outflows - can’t do that directly
						4. Monitoring
					3. Configuration is much more dimensional, and a larger space than increasing inputs
					4. You can have n inputs, and m internal nodes
					5. Internal changes are necessarily discrete, molecular. Inflow changes are quantitative
			2. Law in general
				1. Law sensu lato, codes
				2. Each law can have analytically
					1. Curried functions and law
					2. Criminal, civil, public 
					3. We have a couple of options for decision makes? which are condoned by which? entities: decision makers - laws - reported effects  - explicit targets  -   implicit targets  -   de facto side effects  -   the receptors of the policy  -   secondary parties  -   third parties
					4. We have a web of possibilities describing different states; total areas of law: - commerce - permitted flows  - taxes  - flows inside economics  -   titles   -   sex and gender  effective policy?
					5. Coordinates; What are court cases argued about? person description of legal agent - humans, sometimes specified by:- age  - race & ethnicity  -   religion  -   gender  -   biological sex  -   belief system  -   wealth and income  -   social class / caste  -   matrimonial status 
					6. Institutions, sometimes specified by : size - budget - stated role
					7. Situation - a set of conditions filled  - at a specific point in spacetime - at specific point along some variable (say, vehicle speed) 
					8. Action 
						1. A list of traceable body movements (insofar as we don’t trace thoughtcrime yet) 
						2. Often abstracted into social context (‘signing a contract’, ‘reading T&C’, etc.) 
					9. Result
						1. A change in the agent’s list of properties, such as
						2. Legal marriage 
						3. Legal gender change 
						4. Contract 
						5. Presence in prison 
						6. Triggering another clause, such as ‘upon signing a contract, it is binding. If a person is in a binding contract and does action defined as contract breach, appropriate measures are used by…’
				3. A law is a pattern of assemblage. A causal relation which stands as a wooden fence in a sea. It can redirect smaller currents. But it is easily broken down by stronger waves. Having deep foundations helps it. Law of Gnon was discussed earlier. It is on that law - natural law, that we must construct our laws. Formation of laws, is regularization of patterns. You plan on going to the gym everyday - that's a law, even if very local. A family receipe handed over generations? That too is law. These individual laws we covered before.
				4. [Hugo Grotius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Grotius) > Before him, rights were above all perceived as attached to objects; after him, they are seen as belonging to persons, as the expression of an ability to act or as a means of realizing something.
				5. As a list of statements of the form: as a person in a situation one should do action, otherwise to expect a result to happen, and also allowing forms
					1. Note: you could add that reaction is ‘by someone’, but you can also make the result as an event trigger for another person’s action. 
					2. Note: the terms in real legal acts are often meant by default and full situation specification is impractical. Example is affirmative action at universities
				6. Laws are many, explicit and implicit, state's regulations are just one of many and subject to various game theoretical conditions
					1. There are input output rules in our human world 
					2. There are ‘physical laws’ 
					3. How much do we rely on the second ones to guide the human one? full emancipation is Hegelian (progressive) spirit.
				7. For any explicit social mechanism to work ( e.g. execution of a given law), a wider set of social conditions is required, in an near-superset relation
					1. [Universal jurisdictioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_jurisdiction) is tricky
					2. Having a loose corpus is also an option [Mos maiorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mos_maiorum) 
				8. Law is 3 types, natural philosophy just a part, hard local, local and big hard, we don't know them 
				9. What you’d do has a couple of meanings general case for a rational agent your country - i.e. legal obligation that specific case specific case but for own person e.g. euthanasia of parent and corresponding levels of punishment matrices
				10. Economical model of cost and benefit		
					1. Externalities to society - is it like nicotine?
					2. And possible future generations
					3. Is dying out of a race an externality?
				11. Policy: set of conditional statements concerning some controlled variables, meaning to influence some matter (hyle), to produce some measurable metrics. 
					1. Corollary 1: the metrics are optimised by the decision making actor for their own purposes ( key NRx belief, that power has appetites, goodwill in not enough, we need skin in the game from rulers)
					2. Corollary 2: official metrics set in not the same as those used by the actor to say whether it's effective
				12. That was the definition of policy - if you accept it, what would be an EFFECTIVE policy?
				13. No moral obligations to non-citizens? on the rights and psychology - how long that takes
				14. What is the shape of the compliance curve? % of broken laws, against libertarian minimalism. A sort of measure of state success? Should it establish a metric on its own? External institute? GDP that that directed
				15. Law - culture gap; different in one culture model, two cultures model, any many cultures; like monopolies, etc
				16. If just imperative, because it’s more ominous what happens after that; that should be unthinkable and extraordinary. 
				17. What Hegel said about freedom is an increase in protocolization, less depending on other humans (like in that entrepreneur example that fights the real world), protocolization gives more of that feeling. nice possible future exploits of that with cryptocurrencies
			3. Where do laws play?
				1. In each society there is a different distribution of persons, situations, actions and feasible results. (No fines under full communism).
				2. You could say that some actions are (sub)culture dependent, and in any society there are many subcultures (groups).
				3. Let’s assume that we 'treat all people equally’, so no age - specific, etc. laws are present. Then still we do have different situations. A state with more agriculture than services will have less situations of legal agents starting a business, etc. Let’s assume situations are equal as well.
					1. In the simplest model, we have just the following syntax for law:	action is legal / illegal
						1. Note: the state is an abstraction. Explanation why the term is still used on its way.
						2. There are various groups, which culture consists of many actions. How does the state choose the binary status legal / illegal for each action?
						3. Total actions are a set of sets of actions of each group.
						4. B: But people belong to many groups at once. A: No, the purpose of the Lebensformen chapter was to argue that membership is exclusive.
						5. Options:
							1. Legal is just the common part 
							2. Legal is all that belongs to some set 
							3. All actions are legal 
							4. Nothing is legal = yyy, impossible
						6. State must react to the fact actions of some agents will trigger reactions of other agents, that might decrease the total number of agents, among other consequences.
						7. The legality of all that are common sounds like a good starting point. Inevitability even. Because who would enforce against something they also do?
						8. This sounds really similar to [Arrow's theorem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arrows-theorem/)
					2. The idea of ‘high standards’
						1. Note: There is Bayesian probability for finding wrongdoers.
						2. Note: in all known societies there is punishment - crime equilibrium where always some people break the law.
						3. Like programming a parallel Brooks robot - survival, search, etc 
						4. [Soft law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_law) 
			4. Law is often taken to relate to morality
				1. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 436 - subset of morality? > This is the sense in which we must understand the State to be based on Religion. States and Laws are nothing else than Religion manifesting itself in the relations of the actual world. This is the essence of the Reformation: Man is in his very nature destined to be free.
				2. [LW post on local validity](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WQFioaudEH8R7fyhm/local-validity-as-a-key-to-sanity-and-civilization) > “There is, I think, a certain intuitive idea that ideally the Law is supposed to embody a subset of morality insofar as it is ever wise to enforce certain kinds of goodness. Murder is bad, and so there's a law against this bad behavior of murder. There's a lot of places where the law is in fact evil, like the laws criminalizing marijuana; that means the law is departing from its purpose, falling short of what it should be. Those who are not real-life straw authoritarians (who are sadly common) will cheerfully agree that there are some forms of goodness, even most forms of goodness, that it is not wise to try to legislate. But insofar as it is ever wise to make law, there's an intuitive sense that law should reflect some particular subset of morally good behavior that we have decided it is wise to enforce with guns, such as "Don't kill people."
			5. There is the problem of agency of the lawmaker
				1. It's about the direct actions, or direct results
				2. Morality of government
				3. Ad Christian politician and abortion
				4. In might be a self denying prophecy, but one can choose in this situation transcending
					1. That might mean the Christian politician voting pro-choice 
				5. Also minimum working age and gangs, speaking truth ( less directly here)
				6. Any correlations with cycles?
				7. Ad abortion - why do people assign moral qualities to as state, like it was their daddy?
			6. Perfect preferences might not be possible
				1. Imagine a crab kingdom, where current diet is 1/6 kelp and 5/6 jellyfish
				2. Improvement to 2/6 kelp and 4/6 jelly fish seems Pareto improvement and dietary maximum
				3. Yet can you meme precisely enough?
				4. What if you spin the machine that goes out of control to create memetic equilibrium at 5/6 kelp and 1/6 jellyfish? That's not healthy!
			7. Having too many laws is very bad
				1. [Legistlative inflation is a term in French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_l%C3%A9gislative)
				2. Hume, RP 13, Mil 117-8 > The Roman Consuls, for some time, decided all causes, without being confined by any positive statutes, till the people, bearing this yoke with impatience, created the decemvirs, who promulgated the twelve tables; a body of laws, which, though, perhaps, they were not equal in bulk to one English act of parliament, were almost the only written rules, which regulated property and punishment, for some ages, in that famous republic.
		3. Emotions 
			1. Evolutionary morality
				1. Human sense of morality, evolved as inclusive fitness maximizer helper is at odds with social order moralities in high complexity environments
				2. Morality as tribe - expressivist - not just personal expressivism, but Schmittian, etc group pointing - allows for Jain - like expressions later; kinda deflationary. See [Quasi realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-realism)
				3. See [Evolutionary ethics]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics) 
				4. Like designing a submarine to the lifestyle of a whale = moral philosophy until psychology; acceptance and power
				5. Bentham tries to ground human behaviour in ‘pleasure principle’, but does not work, for not all obey it - imprecise relative to evolutionary structure - might seem that we possess an innate matrix.
				6. When we add evolutionary psychology results; that we were made for survival and reproduction, neither happiness nor truth seeking
				7. We need to treat moral reflexes as heuristics which they are List them as explanations of behaviour, which would fit better to me now? Limited states, hierarchy
				8. There used to be no difference between the logical and practical
				9. And that reterritorialized on some codes, etc
			2. Game theoretic ethics
				1. If evil is negative sum game
				2. Then good must be plus sum game, neutral zero sum game
				3. Then lawful - chaotic is just approach to old and new solutions
				4. What if net pain gains? how judged?
				5. Unknown effects problem
					1. Intention problem
					2. Can be consequentialist or 
					3. When you consider the good / evil of a party, agent, you need to put power / responsibility together with an intention axis. You cannot judge consequences a priori when you accept someone into the team.
					4. The goal of not restricting vocabulary, just expanding, still calling things their old names
					5. You just have an implicit expected value function in your brain for every person you know that you update - that is what our brain is for, quite testable
						1. Make some VR experiments
					6. Unknown results with other parties problem
						1. Just an explicit answer?
					7. Objection - just utilitarianism
						1. Only when multiple parties
						2. Definition of agents might be time / complexity dependent
						3. What is the ‘gain here’? The dialectic. that is transcendental, hard to pin down. Is destroying many crops and causing famine good for making people more resilient, etc. Is making boogaloo to accelerate your country into destruction to speed up giving over the Mandate of Heaven?
					8. Objection - time framing
						1. Is it to judge every particular solution? judging solution on its own merit is a conservative move, into revolutionary
						2. Reactive approach - in the widest timeframe that you are considering
						3. Hypothesis: there always exists at least a neutral strategy. 
			3. Hope
				1. Hope, and civilization is also human condition - ad social vs essence
				2. The world can get better, at least locally, hope is a valid core human experience
				3. That was only locally getting better, ie a unidimensional transition
				4. Doesn’t change the global view, doesn’t mean it will globally rise, that we won’t crash into zero sum games
				5. Two axis model
					1. Logos- ness of the world, vs chaos of the world
					2. Meliorism of the human condition, ability to make the world better for humans (in any sense)
				6. High magic is high logos, as many people see that realm of reality. low magic is more dark (many such cases)
				7. Socially
					1. High on both are ruling ideaologies, so powerful that get enough of normies to overpower anything else
					2. Medium is for well faring independent actors
					3. Low on both is helpless sufferers
					4. High logos, negative condition is the ultimate villain tier
					5. Negative conditions = there is a guarantee of global dowards trend, good moments are fleets of hapiness increasingly rare on the global scale
					6. Neutral condition = things can get better for you locally with art / effort / luck, there is no guarantee it will rise globally
					7. Positive condition = tihngs will get better with effort / art / knowledge, it is doable and leads to global persistent gains
					8. Low logos are more of a hunch variant, if something is a systemattic body of thought / philosopy, there is a selection bias for people who do see the logos. Those who don’t see it become writers less often. Ergo, high logos is white supremacy, it rewards Protestant work ethics, delayed gratifiation (low time preference), and punctuality, etc, etc,
					9. Pessimistic nihilism as self-fulfilling prophecy
					10. The human preference for high logos = pattern and agent detection
				8. We can place any stateent on these scales
				9. Ability to percept logos in the world is a function of mind (inteligence, neurodivergence of the observer), sustituable by embedded foreign intelligence (low IQ religious people not seeing God directly in His works, etc, but through being told so)
					1. Possibly [depressive realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_realism)
				10. The place of that person’s web of beliefs to the reachable-physical one - which we don’t know if it’s possible to reach, and that’s the optimistic view
				11. Optimism - [we cling to order](https://genius.com/Perturbator-eclipse-lyrics)
				12. The logos condition corresponding to the scientific endeavour, the human condition one to the engineering one
				13. Logos here is not about order, a black hole is ordered and does not support life directly; it’s about human - knowable set of systematic rules, ‘science’ if you will
				14. The logos is the sort of utlimate knowable web of beliefs, one that you’d obtain by doing all the experiments, trying out alll verifiable hypotheses
				15. There might still be true randomness left afterwards
				16. It’s the limit that is approached, not monotonically
				17. Ofc human beliefs aren’t an instant database
				18. The process of becoming logos - apt is the course of any science, from regularities in chaos we derive eternal rules - during the process of development of scientific field, or even individual cognitition of it, Humeanism about the laws gives rise to, via our order-desire, to realism about scientific laws. That is the relationshp at large.
			4. Moral feelings
				1. Are moral truths are like scientific truths? - great coincidence, but this might not work on social level
				2. If our moral judgements are based on elusive feelings, so does philosophy.
				3. Law cases that need to be covered
				4. Human instincts common enough to need being accounted for
				5. Is caring for things after our death = imagining another's mental state is time - independent - falsifiable neurologically; that is we can imagine and value as strongly their feelings after our death as before it
				6. Under the evolutionary assumption children and the weak not moral agents in the usual sense, tribal evolutionary morality. only inasmuch someone is useful and their discounted future potential, depending on their chances of survival; feeble children until 10 were expendable 
				7. In ethics formalize assumptions of natural ethics
					1. Ethics is within us
					2. We have limited capability to impose it on the world
				8. If ethics = pleasure
					1. It’s the same calculus, the same relation desire - world
				9. Make a table liberal rules vs moral instincts - hasn’t Haidt done that?
					1. Humanistic personality ideal
					2. Esse est percipi  ⇒ we perceive things that are not there through object permanence - just like cause and effect. they are equal type of assumptions, like 3d space, that we can’t get rid of 
				10. It is absurd (impractical now) to posit an ‘equal standard for all human behaviour’. these used to be station and gender speciifc, now it’s the time to abstrct it to the notion of agents and matter - Object oriented law. ‘Humans’ have broadly different roles in assemblages and exposure to them, so that human A operating witihn assemblage Aa will never understand the unique assemblage - perspective (!important term in this ethics) of human B operating and making decisions in the context of assemblage Ba. and it’s useless to limit it to humans, judge any matter by the same standards - law needs to be abstracted and ready ofr posthumans
			5. Status as zero sum
				1. Status is a zero sum game. and in stable conditions it is increasingly against Gnon - as the ‘hardest but reachable’ things become competitive in status. that superstructure escalates until the base is destroyed
		4. Necessities
			1. It needs to have a solid game-theoretic basis
				1. John Rawls proposes a world state composed of agents, is there a game theory discussion of incentives to achieve and keep that state? if not, book’s not worth it
			2. There is latent complexity in the society
				1. Political philosophies, normative ones aspire to reduce capital driven complexity pushed by living in the society. Untenable model, that is to the idea that all quadrants want less layers 
				2. There’s this thing called history - complexity, where memory preserves some portion of complexity locally, increasing the local complexity
				3. Value of complexity, as opposed to use value. Related to intelligence, but embedded. ntelligence is a subset of complexity.
					1. Egg is more complex than chicken, it contains many individual chickens
			3. It needs to cope with memetic powers
				1. It doesn't matter if you're wrong if you can convince the world that you're right
				2. [A Critique of Neo-Left Ontology by Carsten Strathausen, 2006](http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/issue.506/16.3strathausen.html) > 26. Put differently, from this perspective, if a theory fails to affect the reality it ponders, it has no active meaning at all, objective or otherwise. A thought that fails to alter the non-discursive, material environment from which it emerges does not exist as thought. It is nothing but a description or a symptom. As such, it may be judged accurate or inaccurate.
				3. In 47. of [A Critique of Neo-Left Ontology by Carsten Strathausen, 2006](http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/issue.506/16.3strathausen.html) > Ontologies literally live (i.e., they become embodied and practiced) by the credo of those who adhere to them, and this credo is not simply a matter of rational power or philosophical logic. There are other forces at work here, such as passion, unconscious beliefs and drives, aesthetics, and, above all, the way in which all of them are expressed, marketed, and "consumed."
			4. Is 'update from the inside' possible?
				1. Carl Schmitt says it's not possible inside of constitution, extra-legal sovereign needs to intervene
				2. Another possible answer is that paradigm shift only possible through competition? that is necessarily bottom up.
				3. Can low-scale habits change the higher 'values' through evolution (top down or bottom up, doesn’t matter)
				4. Then what degree of crystallicity of customs? can they subvert the abstract values? This follows from logic and the history of Kuhnian science
			5. You'll be faced with your past path[Path dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence) 
				1. Establishing nature of the movement [wandering set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_set) the Universe is dissipative
				2. [Ergodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis) can only be for smaller dimensions for our purposes (ergodic universe is too much)
				3. We can assume some exploration cosntant for the past. it might not have been enough, but we can guess that the Lindy effect also applies to lack of developments
				4. Reverse Lindy effect - what still hasn't happened, will not happen for another time
				5. [If a designed object has required very few changes over 100 years, it’s probably close to perfect. ](https://chrisforce.substack.com/p/35-opinel?s=r)
					1. This can be for things with small size and cybernetic loop that went many times over with decent level of selective pressures
				6. What is the total number of hours humanity devoted to different things? assuming perfect exchange, what is how valuable? 
					1. Predation for example has millions of years of past. but has exhausted.
				7. The graph of total hours - it's quite important ocean-wise.
			6. Limits to efficiency
				1. Red oceans have cladistic dynamics - ie more depending on past selective pressures than the surrounding Outside
					1. On average two different paths that we see at snapshot now are Bayesianilly different in deep origins than in recent. Which means no rough turns. This is connected to the cladistics argument. 
					2. Obviously in the case of radiation, the structure is less path dependent. It's more dependent on the structure of the outside,
					3. So obviously relationships in a red ocean are cladistic ones.
					4. You're either stuck to your past or the Outside
					5. Outside is freedom from the past
				2. There are absolute limits to efficiency
					1. XS, stupid monsters > So how ‘loyally’ does the human mind slave itself to gene-proliferation imperatives? Extremely flakily, evidently. The long absence of large, cognitively autonomous brains from the biological record — up until a few million years ago — strongly suggests that mind-slaving is a tough-to-impossible problem. The willto-think essentially supplants ulterior directives, and can be reconciled to them only by the most extreme subtleties of instinctual cunning. Biology, which had total control over the engineering process of human minds, and an absolutely unambiguous selective criterion to work from, still struggles to ‘guide’ the resultant thought-processes in directions consistent with genetic proliferation, through the perpetual intervention of a fantastically complicated system of chemical arousal mechanisms, punishments, and rewards. The stark truth of the matter is that no human being on earth fully mobilizes their cognitive resources to maximize their number of off-spring. We’re vaguely surprised to find this happen at a frequency greater than chance — since it very often doesn’t. So nature’s attempt to build a ‘paperclipper’ has conspicuously failed. 
			7. Need to solve time-completeness of ethics
				1. What timeframe do you optimize your 'ethic' for?
				2. A simple solution is just optimizing your own adherence to the specified pattern
					1. E.g. in the ethic-as-good-life, not as morality
				3. But would you corrupt the pattern inside you to make it more popular among others?
				4. Or among those future ones?
				5. Kantianism gets tricky when universalization is along the time dimension
				6. This problem is most visible for utilitarianism
				7. Inifinite worlds of Buddhism / Stoicism also present a special case
				8. The general conclusion is that time-completeness of ethic is a maximalization problem for the universalists, not particularists
		5. Heuristics
			1. You can't have it all in the general case
				1. Intuition non-preservation theorem (like Copernican principle) - no place is privileged to fill all our moral and descriptive intuitions, any given configuration has no guarantee of preservation
			2. Hume, RP 25, Mil 124 - evolutionary view - we definitely shouldn’t treat laws equally depending on time they have been present > To balance a large state or society, whether monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so great difficulty, that no human genius, however comprehensive, is able, by the mere dint of reason and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of many must unite in this work: Experience must guide their labour: Time must bring it to perfection: And the feeling of inconveniencies must correct the mistakes, which they inevitably fall into, in their first trials and experiments 
			3. Not only basic state, target state the way, but also response to the way. It is not like guiding society through the map of possibilities, there are reflexive dynamics
			4. There might be some form of inhibition of return, where it's not possible to return directly to what was immediately before
			5. If you hit a wall (see a repetition) you can see a real limit
				1. [Multiple discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery)
				2. Every time you see something repeating itself you should see a limit of possiblity, edge of a plane of consistency
				3. Hegel said every situation is unique - embracing the high dimensionality space for the journey of humanity
				4. Lost in a large space vs locked in a small space - in both cases things repeat
				5. There's physical hitting the wall - inputs rise exponentially to maintain linear output
				6. Leftists see that it's similar thing in a different place. RW sees perennial struggle on a small space
				7. But fundamentally if we see repetition, that's some constraint on space, along some axis, of our n-torus
				8. There's some wall that we can hit. our position wrt it is either anthropic effect or mediocrity principle
				9. We can say that our models are greater than reality? that's a RW point.
			6. You need to balance the levels
				1. This applies to any size
				2. Ancaps are wrong about nature of power. They like to contrast violence (state) with voluntary contracts. Yet nonstate agents also are in power networks and their power-enforcerers can breach contracts yet go unnoticed
					1. It's more reobust to have your behaviours spread out
					2. You need to monitor both ends. if the higher assemblage crumbles, should you reduce your power?
				3. Nomadic cells operate
					1. Idependently of big assemblages - that puts lower limit on their size
					2. Not fascist by themselves - upper limit on them
				4. Some practices, of quasi-religous nature, to keep between the both ends (totalitarian and det)
				5. Not one mind to that
				6. If they are religious they are more persistent, as coupled with that which is not changeable visibly
				7. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 418 >This question of appropriation is so varied historically that it is necessary to distinguish between several kinds of problems. The first concerns the possibility of the operation: it is precisely because war is only the supplementary or synthetic object of the nomad war machine that it experiences the hesitation that proves fatal to it, and that the State apparatus for its part is able to lay hold of war and thus turn the war machine back against the nomads. The hesitation of the nomad is legendary: What is to be done with the lands conquered and crossed? Return them to the desert, to the steppe, to open pastureland? Or let a State apparatus survive that is capable of exploiting them directly, at the risk of becoming, sooner or later, simply a new dynasty of that apparatus: sooner or later because Genghis Khan and his followers were able to hold out for a long time by partially integrating themselves into the conquered empires, while at the same time maintaining a smooth space on the steppes to which the imperial centers were subordinated. That was their genius, the Pax Mongolica.
				8. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 366 - 367 > The fourth and final thesis of schizoanalysis is therefore the distinction between two poles of social libidinal investment: the paranoiac, reactionary, and fascisizing pole, and the schizoid revolutionary pole. Once again, we see no objection to the use of terms inherited from psychiatry for characterizing social investments of the unconscious, insofar as these terms cease to have a familial connotation that would make them into simple projections, and from the moment delirium is recognized as having a primary social content that is immediately adequate. The two poles are defined, the one by the enslavement of production and the desiring-machines to the gregarious aggregates that they constitute on a large scale under a given form of power or selective sovereignty; the other by the inverse subordination and the overthrow of power. Tlie one by these molar structured aggregates that crush singularities, select them, and regularize those that they retain in codes or axiomatics; the other by the molecular multiplicities of singularities that on the contrary treat the large aggregates as so many useful materials for their own elaborations. The one by the lines of integration and territorialization that arrest the flows, constrict them, turn them back, break them again according to the limits interior to the system, in such a way as to produce the images that come to fill the field of immanence peculiar to this system or this aggregate, the other by lines of escape that follow the decoded and deterritorialized flows, inventing their own nonfigurative breaks or schizzes that produce new flows, always breaching the coded wall or the territorialized limit that separates them from desiring-production. And to summarize all the preceding determinations: the one is defined by subjugated groups, the other by subject-groups.
	16. There are heuristics at each stage
		1. Ultimately tactics and boundary conditions merge in a certain sense
		2. There are limited beliefs that we are bound to have. Now what about action?Our execution and re-structuring of cybernetic netowrks?
		3. There is evil, actions to be shunned in the world. They impact you. Better world is metaphysically possible ( wider than physically?
		4. Actions at hold
			1. Aesthetics as waste
				1. Aesthetic are function without return, anything that lasts short. and that is relative, therefore existence and the world, as having no outside, are aesthetic
				2. [Nietzche's > “it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified.”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/355873-it-is-only-as-an-aesthetic-phenomenon-that-existence-and) 
				3. That is the same notion as the [Bataillean notion of waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accursed_Share)
				4. You can overshoot with rise-time-gained value and it's triggering some ratchets? 
				5. You need to increase *aesthetic* as a controlled black hole
				6. Types of enjoyments 
					1. Positive feedback loop - gym and lifting 
					2. Optimization for a specific goal with non monotonous factors - reduction / mass cycle 
					3. 'Cutting the excess’ of something - weight loss 
					4. Putting a few bits to perfection - body modeling
			2. Against idee fixe
				1. The market approach to assemblage creation relies on relative target - the perennial one relies on some past ideal target
				2. The left wing approach is fundamentally to expand the mind outwards, like Hume disliked
				3. Imposing the will of humanity upon things - but that's limited by Gnon - only some things can be accomplished
					1. And to check for that it’s best to try if more elements of your system are deterritorialized
				4. Tbh left wing action is deterritorialized with chemicals in water, so there's that
				5. If humanity were to put its will onto the universe, the results would be disastrous - not enough abstraction

				I am Hobbesian, I see war in the nature state
			3. Assemblage problems - the main task of the hold
				1. What can be wrong with a state (assemblage)
					1. No common will / parasites (temporal difference)
					2. Low replacement
				2. Either constituent parts don't cooperate or they don't perpetuate themselves through time
				3. These are the 2 fundamnetal problems
			4. Avoid fascism
				1. And fascism is that water serpent that needs slaying
				2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,230 >A bizarre remark by Virilio puts us on the trail: in fascism, the Stateis far less totalitarian than it is suicidal. There is in fascism a realized nihilism. Unlike the totalitarian State, which does its utmost to seal all possible lines of flight, fascism is constructed on an intense line of flight, which it transforms into a line of pure destruction and abolition.
				3. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,231 >Paul Virilio's analysis strikes us as entirely correct in defining fascism notby the notion of the totalitarian State but by the notion of the suicidal State:so-called total war seems less a State undertaking than an undertaking of awar machine that appropriates the State and channels into it a flow of abso-lute war whose only possible outcome is the suicide of the State itself.
			5. Avoiding hold at all
				1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 165 > The test of desire: not denouncing false desires, but distinguishing within desire between that which pertains to stratic proliferation, or else too-violent destratification, and that which pertains to the construction of the plane of consistency (keep an eye out for all that is fascist, even inside us, and also for the suicidal and the demented).
			6. Bad diagonals
				1. This happens mostly under red oceans [diagonalizing currents - a failure mode of red oceans](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-01-political-advocacy-groups-jeopardize-zika.html)
			7. Changing the mid
				1. [Diamond dependency](https://jlbp.dev/what-is-a-diamond-dependency-conflict) 
					1. When some material conditions (low level) change
					2. To preserve high-level values
					3. You might need to change some mid level habits
			8. Cutting the top
				1. Like a regulated river vs a big irregular one
				2. Fascism is about cutting side chains, but in botany cutting the main one to allow side ones to spread is what makes sense
				3. And hero kills the top
				4. And necessarily the top is inhuman, it used scaling options to get that high
				5. Don’t lend resources to poorly optimized assemblages - cutting the top is the subset of that
				6. Liberation is freeing up these lines of flight
				7. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 358 > The importance of this thesis is first of all to draw attention to collective mechanisms of inhibition. These mechanisms may be subtle, and function as micromechanisms. This is easily seen in certain band or pack phenom- ena. For example, in the case of gangs of street children in Bogota, Jacques Meunier cites three ways in which the leader is prevented from acquiring stable power: the members of the band meet and undertake their theft activity in common, with collective sharing of the loot, but they disperse to eat or sleep separately; also, and especially, each member of the band is paired off with one, two, or three other members, so if he has a disagree- ment with the leader, he will not leave alone but will take along his allies, whose combined departure will threaten to break up the entire gang; finally, there is a diffuse age limit, and at about age fifteen a member is inevitably induced to quit the gang.
			9. Daoism to overproduction
				1. Daoism preaches non action as doing your usual duty. This is obviously useful for keeping peasants from uprising, but most of them are keeping to themselves. The highest impact is from keeping the overproduced elites from trying to change things in their ' smart' yet ultimately limited view
			10. Don't lend resources to poorly optimized assemblages
			11. There is a tradeoff between local feedback loops and global feedbck loops 
				1. You can invest resources into local skill, that translates using some% into advantage of the global one. here probably is necessary to even see the local loop for itself for it to be effective
				2. Training for training vs for other-thing effects
			12. Freezing levels
				1. To freeze some levels of an assemblage is to stall lower complexity assemblages in their development, in the state where you had a predictable surplus value captured from them. Then you obtain some specific type of output
			13. Hardness of distinction
				1. How to distinguish between resources siphoned of for a long range shot from just parasitic?
			14. Many layer protocols have an advantage
				1. [Diversity prevents invasioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasibility#Biotic_factors)
				2. Diversity of niche is one of the elements of system resilience
					1. Up to a point...
				3. If you want to accomplish n tasks, it’s better to split them between many entities. Since Fordism. That permits faster change, as each organization is smaller, and the change is more anonymous, working on interorganizational, not interhuman level - less friction and resistance.
				4. One layer is putting all your eggs in one basket, to things like ghost company towns.
				5. Competing hierarchies work by increasing internal structure, but information speed is limited. So the winner has more, but might crumble later and fall harder.
				6. Meeting of different protocols.
					1. N, or even n+1 layer would lose to a freshly consolidated n + 1, because of lack of spillage and the boost in direct confrontation.
					2. N + 1 after time would lose to n layer through mereologization.
					3. N vs n+1 is in dynamic equilibrium.
				7. Kind of like a 2048 game.
					1. They join to become stronger, but the landscape is never dominated by just one layer (unless in the beginning)
					2. The later the harder to match
				8. Consolidated is depth first search, extended breadth first.
				9. Egalitarian phases are only temporary for another configuration.
					1. Marxist claim of revolution - he underestimated, thought that this might end. 
				10. There is no true, positive end of hierarchy.
			15. Allowing some mutation
				1. Mutation should be allowed depending on the curves and absolute space
			16. No need to purge relics
				1. Coelcanth and Sentinel Island exist - there is little value in purging relicts, they need to be protected so that better venues are exploited
					1. Unless there is heavy resource scarcity
				2. The pwoer you need is probably not from the simple ones
				3. That is dependent on the speed of information, that is as the economy / biomass / pages grow, in the exponential growth phase there is not enough time for that pattern to reach remote places.
			17. [Orthopraxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopraxy) = 'doing > believing'
				1. Compliant with logic based on targets 
					1. Utilitarianism
					2. Divine command theory
				2. Humans have different mental black boxes, only the behaviour is observable
				3. In ortodoxies the gnostic belief signal race is a degenerative ratchet
				4. Orthopraxy is checked more often, therefore a further limit of being correct
				5. Orthopraxy is more regulated by the Outside

					4. [Reddit user ruaidhri> I don't think belief is important. Historically and in more modern times, paganism is and was more orthopraxic than orthodixic. The idea of orthodoxy, right belief, only really comes into being with Christianity becoming a majority religion in antiquity. You do your rituals, you say your prayers, you get initiated into the Mysteries. These are all things you do, not things you believe.  No God requires your belief, at least not in the same way that faith is a core requirement of say Christianity or Islam. You can be pagan and meditate/do rituals/prayer/worship and not be sure if Gods exist. If Gods exist you've done your best to honour and respect them, and I doubt that Gods would care that us humans with our current state of knowledge don't fully "believe"- because as Gods they are self sufficient and they require nothing from us. If they don't exist you're still tapping into something with your practice, so it's a win-win as I see it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/paganism/comments/qme44z/wanting_to_believe_vs_believing/)

Local custom vs authoritative law - [wikipedia Hinduism and Judaism article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_and_Judaism) >Bernard Jackson points out the extent to which legal regulations, customs, and royal ordinances in Halakha in the Jewish tradition and Dharmaśāstra among Hindus are binding on members of their respective societies. Jackson adds that both Jewish and Hindu law evidence a great sensitivity to the interplay of local custom and authoritative law. He says that in both religions, the writing down of a collection of norms did not necessarily mean that all or even most norms were intended to be enforced, and that the laws connected with royal authority were not necessarily statutory. Wendy Doniger states that Hinduism and Judaism are alike in their tendency toward orthopraxy rather than orthodoxy.

			18. Outsourcing to the Outside
				1. Outside is a generalized form of Gnon, who can be thought of as the Ultimate Outside.
				2. Also the right wing is a bit more deterritorialized than the left wing
				3. When you write a weekly schedule of task, you deterritorialize planning from your mind
					1. You put it to the Outside, rather than the changeable mind
				4. Similar with Tradition, maybe not necessarily with Monarchy, need to establish them separately
			19. Prioritizing some particular axis is bad
				1. No hierarchy along any particular axis in-the-world is *necessary*. Closeness to Gnon is an occult axis. 
					1. Re: > The red pill might lead to an epiphany about the rightness of white nationalism and/or the repudiation of feminism, multiculturalism, leftism, liberalism, and globalism, followed by the embrace of traditionalism, hierarchy, and inequality. There are thousands of red-pilling stories, each one slightly different, yet they all pivot around transformation. (Stern 2019)
				2. Hierarchical submission can be contractual or violence based.
			20. Purely homeostatic cycles
				1. There are assemblages with clear homeostasis circuits - that is the peak of that assemblage-as-it-is. It must have latent re-establishment forces that you disrupt by interactiing with it.
				2. We can define a 'pure homeostatic' circuit that can't be improved in any way. We'd need to provide a closed environment.
				3. What would be the features? how can we measure which assemblages are similar?
			21. The danger of dissociation
				1. [A Critique of Vipassana Meditation as taught by Mr S N Goenka Harmanjit Singh 2007, page 14](http://eldar.cz/kangaroo/mirror/vipassana-critique.pdf) > ‘Two thousand years of dissociative spiritual practices in India have changed the psyche of its people so deeply that they genuinely consider this earth and the universe as a subjective creation with their only loyalty or faith (howsoever half-baked) in some God or in some other non-physical realm. Hence, they regard any occurrence in the outside world only with as much importance as it interferes with their own life. The awareness that there are other subjective entities, and the civic responsibility and order this awareness implies, is understandably absent in Indian society. The Indian psyche is already dissociated from the world to some extent. ‘ 
				2. [A Critique of Vipassana Meditation as taught by Mr S N Goenka Harmanjit Singh 2007, page 18](http://eldar.cz/kangaroo/mirror/vipassana-critique.pdf) > ‘There is another value to the random associative chatter of the brain, and that is: it may form unexpected connections and make new discoveries. That is why some out-of-the-box solutions to long-standing problems may appear while daydreaming or while dreaming at night when free association is in progress. I make the unveriﬁed claim here that creative people and inventors will be severely crippled by a non-chattering brain. Their creativity and fresh ideas can only come from new neural pathways established by random ﬁring of the neurons and a hypoxia-induced state of low neural activity will be a handicap for such people. People doing habitual jobs requiring low amounts of creative thinking, including students (who need to ingest information given in books and lectures) will be helped a lot by any concentration or calming practice. ‘ >‘ The teaching of equanimity is explicit, rather than it being an insight of the student. Mr Goenka makes it a point to repeatedly suggest to students that they should not like or dislike the sensations, because they are impermanent. Impermanence is not a factor left to be individually experienced by the students; it is almost made a mantra by the Vipassana meditators (Anicca Anicca Anicca). An actual experiencing of impermanence is made a conditioned discovery due to the repetitive proclamations by Mr Goenka that all sensations are impermanent, and that that is why any craving or aversion towards them will lead to suﬀering. It might be true, but the insight is spoon-fed to the students, students are not given time to develop this insight on their own’
			22. Tumor removal
				1. Memeplex deprecation / apoptosis is the necessary mechanism to remove tumours - more dimensions system can remove through out-competing but that can take time
				2. How often to screen for tumours? how often to check for consistency - cybernetic loop size? 
		3. Actions at plex
			1. Dutch disease can bring you down to Plex
				1. A: Is that each stage of technology permits consecutively higher complexity societies? 
				2. B: If yes, only as a heuristics. And what it means must be precise, it does not necessarily mean bigger countries. If you got at the same time technology enabling efficient urban vertical farming and a military tech, some super vermin that works on large scale rural farms. Another case Dutch disease - like - if your moon colony in 300 years, in 2420, after 200 years of urbanization and development of service economy, would discover a new tech, with a straightforward and needed at the moment application, to use moon rocks. Or the so called ‘suicide pact technology’. Any technology that makes complexity redundant, relatively expensive, or attacks components of complexity directly. 
				3. A: You mentioned no historical examples. Might it be that when a culture/area 'breaks' into the next technological stage, the transition is accompanied by power shifts, often violent (1100 BCE, 30 years war, 1870 war, WW2)? 
				4. B: That might fill that role of reducing complexity, at least in the short term decreased number of people would do that. But remember that the notion of technological stage is dubious, a posteriori of historical societies. That you could think technologies x, y, z belong in the same ‘technological stage’, but there are at least some exceptional cases when it is not so. What is more, as global technology converged (especially 1500s onwards) we really lack examples of how tech tree might have gone differently. Of course, there is limited headroom, but if say, Incan empire developed without wheels and with a distinctive writing system, chances are low all such non obvious combinations were discovered, or thought of. 
				5. A: Is it that just ’smaller is better’? 
				6. B: Not quite, that would be an oversimplification. But yes, a lean structure of units in the structure, focused on specialized tasks, with more direct links and limiting intermediaries is desirable for a structure. So smaller units would be better, and the structure does not benefit from growing in all ways, though it must grow. Smaller unit size is the way to go, that is co-current with specialization.
			2. Overstaying in the rise phase when the energy has ran out pushes you hard into the Plex
				1. In some time, infinite growth with finite resources must shift to a lower resource - dependent growth (the direction of digitalization of goods) to sustain, or massive mereologization processes might occur. Or get new resources to build on.
				2. You only have that much time in the blue and purple phase to avoid a total Malthusian disruption - each level has only so much time.
			3. Rejecting power also leaves you at mercy of the cthonic forces
				1. Not to refuse any power, because modernity is conscious optimization; return to tradition rejects this choice, this power - being ruled by territorialities; if you see that you can optimize, you can’t not do it; once you see it, ignoring is the wrong choice given free market of competittors
		4. Actions at rise
			1. Can't just destroy them all at once
				1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,160 >You have to keep enough of the organism for it to reform each dawn; and you have to keep small supplies of signifiance and subjectification, if only to turn them against their own systems when the circumstances demand it,when things, persons, even situations, force you to; and you have to keep small rations of subjectivity in sufficient quantity to enable you to respond to the dominant reality. Mimic the strata. You don't reach the BwO, and its plane of consistency, by wildly destratifying. That is why we encountered the paradox of those emptied and dreary bodies at the very beginning:
				2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 161 > If you free it with too violent an action, if you blow apart the strata without taking precautions, then instead of drawing the plane you will be killed, plunged into a black hole, or even dragged toward catastrophe. Staying stratified—organized, signified, subjected—is not the worst that can happen; the worst that can happen is if you throwthe strata into demented or suicidal collapse, which brings them back downon us heavier than ever. This is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, tryout continuums of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of newland at all times. It is through a meticulous relation with the strata that one succeeds in freeing lines of flight, causing conjugated flows to pass andescape and bringing forth continuous intensities for a BwO. Connect, con-jugate, continue: a whole "diagram," as opposed to still signifying and subjective programs. We are in a social formation; first see how it is stratified for us and in us and at the place where we are; then descend from the stratato the deeper assemblage within which we are held; gently tip the assem-blage, making it pass over to the side of the plane of consistency. It is only there that the BwO reveals itself for what it is: connection of desires, con-junction of flows, continuum of intensities.
				3. Absolute det as something that benefits nothing real, no assemblage that is here
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 56 > Absolute deterritorialization is not defined as a giant accelerator; its absoluteness does not hinge on how fast it goes. It is actually possible to reach the absolute by way of phenomena of relative slowness or delay.Retarded development is an example. What qualifies a deterritorialization is not its speed (some are very slow) but its nature, whether it constitutes epistrata and parastrata and proceeds by articulated segments or, on the contrary, jumps from one singularity to another following anondecom-posable, non segmentary line drawing a metastratum of the plane of consistency.
			2. Exploration strategies
				1. [Ant colony optimization mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms) 
				2. [Langton's ant - very relevant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) 
				3. [Evolutionary stable strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy) 
			3. Failure mode changing too often
				1. [Hill climbing bad - successful first step - peaking in high school, etc - first step fallacy](https://philpapers.org/rec/DREAHO-2) 
				2. That failure mode of changing the action too often not waiting for feedback
			4. Failure mode spread too thin
				1. Spreading too thin failure mode - you open too many oceans, and everyone gets on top
				2. Pterosapiens (All Tomorrows page 71) is such an blue ocean failure - not enough concentration of complexity to create pressures (red ocean) to force intelligence-complexity to arise at aggregate level (society). Too much exit and smooth spaces
			5. Additional resources, if given only to things close to Gnon should provide the best returns
			6. Growing the top
				1. A method of exploration and exploitation might be a T shaped structure
				2. An optimized trunk and diverse test leafs which are at the edge of deterritorialization
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 34 > When the pack forms a ring around the fire, each man will have neighbors to the right and left, but no one behind him; his back is naked and exposed to the wilderness." We recognize this as the schizo position, being on the periphery, holding on by a hand or a foot. . . As opposed to the paranoid position of the mass subject, with all the identifications of the individual with the group, the group with the leader, and the leader with the group; be securely embedded in the mass, get close to the center, never be at the edge except in the line of duty.
				3. Being at the edge of deterritorialization is an honour and duty, even if extra territorial - a blessing of Gnon
				4. Hierarchies and collectivist ideologies are for one skill set, exploit phase, maximizing specific output
				5. Free market is when hierarchies intersect, maximizing total output, directed economy
				6. Socially wise, a T shaped assemblage structure is safe, less interlocking changes and more selective application of developed assemblages, easier to experiment there
				7. Growing the top is exploration, feeding the bottom is exploitation
				8. Then you get everyone on top and no one needs to build new things. Red oceans and maintenance. Normalizing blue oceans increases this. 
			7. Growing the wave from a blue ocean - to change red oceans you need force that can be built up from free energy from blue oceans (nomadic war machines)
				1. Part 2 chapter 36 BAM > look north: to the Manchus and other Tungus-peoples hardened in the taiga and the Arctic, to the freedom-loving Mongols who to this day love nothing more than to drive out into open country with no roads and consider our cities horribly claustrophobic. Actually in history when you look at life of true nomads who are always on the move and in openspace, they never engage in the kind of depressive introspection and questioning of life that you only see in settled and civilized peoples
				2. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 417 >But more generally, we have seen that the war machine was the invention of the nomad, because it is in its essence the constitutive element of smooth space, the occupation of this space, displacement within this space, and the corresponding composition of people: this is its sole and veritable positive object (nomos). Make the desert, the steppe, grow; do not depopulate it, quite the contrary. If war necessarily results, it is because the war machine collides with States and cities, as forces (of striation) opposing its positive object: from then on, the war machine has as its enemy the State, the city, the state and urban phenomenon, and adopts as its objective their annihilation. It is at this point that the war machine becomes war: annihilate the forces of the State, destroy the State-form. The Attila, or Genghis Khan, adventure clearly illustrates this progression from the positive object to the negative object.
			8. Handling both input and output
				1. In order to limit mereologization of systems Like in the [energy pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid), you need to either increase sun output (raw energy available to the system), or increase the decomposition stream (reinvestment, innovation). 
				2. What is needed is an output stream from the top as well as from the bottom. That could be in a populistic form, but that does not grow complexity, can stop its decrease though. To increase complexity the culture of the elite must focus on that innovation, finding new, productive niches.
			9. Hell baking
				1. XS, hell baked > The logical consequence of Social Darwinism is that everything of value has been built in Hell. It is only due to a predominance of influences that are not only entirely morally indifferent, but indeed — from a human perspective — indescribably cruel, that nature has been capable of constructive action. Specifically, it is solely by way of the relentless, brutal culling of populations that any complex or adaptive traits have been sieved — with torturous inefficiency — from the chaos of natural existence. All health, beauty, intelligence, and social grace has been teased from a vast butcher’s yard of unbounded carnage, requiring incalculable eons of massacre to draw forth even the subtlest of advantages. This is not only a matter of the bloody grinding mills of selection, either, but also of the innumerable mutational abominations thrown up by the madness of chance, as it pursues its directionless path to some negligible preservable trait, and then — still further — of the unavowable horrors that ‘fitness’ (or sheer survival) itself predominantly entails. We are a minuscule sample of agonized matter, comprising genetic survival monsters, fished from a cosmic ocean of vile mutants, by a pitiless killing machine of infinite appetite. (This is still, perhaps, to put an irresponsibly positive spin on the story, but it should suffice for our purposes here.
				2. XS, hell baked > What is it that Neoreaction — perhaps I should say The Dark Enlightenment — has to offer the world, if all goes optimally (which, of course, it won’t)? Really, the honest answer to this question is: Eternal Hell. It’s not an easy marketing brief. We could perhaps try: But it could be worse (and almost certainly will be).
			10. Rising from the bottom
				1. Body building is like witchcraft - empowering through passing waste, achieveing non-state power
				2. Optimizations at the lowest level are by definition easier - therefore focus on them is recommended
			11. Worse is better - 	 The good system is the one that creates better productivity short term with dysfunctions grow long term. [Worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better).
		5. Actions at sink
			1. Doesn't apply, as that occurs on its own
		6. Actions at warp
			1. Is it possible to break cycles?	
				1. The main question that arises is that if [the cycle can be broken?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3kzvkAeLk) Or maybe [incorporating the cycle](https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/little-rebellionquotation) into the system?
			2. Exit / smooth spaces is not enough
				1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 500 smooth spaces not enough > Of course, smooth spaces are not in themselves liberatory. But the struggle is changed or displaced in them, and life reconstitutes its stakes, confronts new obstacles, invents new paces, switches adversaries. Never believe that a smooth space will suffice to save us.
			3. Exploration exploitation here can be considered in many ways
				1. We can borrow patterns for search paths [different search paths paper](https://www.mba.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/Humphries&Sims_LevySearchSimulations_JTB2014.pdf) 
				2. Exploration - shift right, exploitation - [shift left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) - in terms of time of error detection / course correction
				3. There are 6 possible strategies ([ from an RL course lesson about the tradeoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGuiWX07sKw))
					1. Trial and error, analogy, insight, means and ends analysis, hillclimbing, backtracking
				4. Each is optimal in different environments
				5. Political ideologies may be similar to one of these (vide [General problem solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver) )
				6. [@robinhouston on twitter> The contrapositive of Chesterton’s Fence is that, if you want to understand what something is for, you should remove it & see what goes wrong. ](https://twitter.com/robinhouston/status/1439708864040034304?s=09)
				7. Each memeplex infects persons as nodes, insofar as they participate in it, they interact with other parts of the assemblage as a node of that Boltzmann machines
				8. [>  Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference, but if the connectivity is properly constrained, the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine)
				9. Current exploitation = total resources - expenses for general expoloration - expenses for future second order exploitation
					1. This remainder is inevitable, given the 
						1. Non-match of resources and desires
						2. Expolitation potential of every desiring machine
						3. The existence of second order exploitations
				10. [Viterbi algorithm may be useful for topology estimatioGnon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm)
			4. Feeding the bottom
				1. Also recall the plants example above, dominating the Earth landmass chart. It was similar 19th century Western urbanization waves accompanying industrialization. The farmers were like bacteria and workers migrating and living in the cities were plants, living on the new energy source - not sunlight, but a capitalist system of wages. Competition for sunlight can also be brutal. 
				2. That is precisely targeted when conscious, whether through the state or not matters less. Think big tech companies giving services and products for free. They treat is as experimentation, specialization cost. Their benefits are great - what people create with it is in their domain, expanding the pool of resources from which they siphon off value. And also they directly get advertising data, but that is of less interest to us here. The same goes with retiring Roman soldiers being given free land to farm. The powers redirect the value that they would not be able to use themselves to loyal people, in the domain that will increase their profits / taxes.
				3. Power to the lower = rise current = low time preference = they naturally have less savings, all sucked up and hence less propensity to save
				4. UK revolution and extensive boundaries
				5. Also like in ecology
					1. General n, n+1 theory; warp as trans n
					2. The most efficient thing if the bottom layer is scarce is to put some output into the lowest level. That is the warp.
			5. Great Statesmen forge new lines of flight
				1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia,225 - 226 > The only "great" Statesmen are those who connect with flows, like pilot-signs or particles-signs, and who emit quanta that get out of the black holes: it is not by chance that these men encounter each other only on lines of flight, in the act of drawing them, sounding them out, following them, or forging ahead of them, even though they may make a mistake and take a fall (Moses the Hebrew,Genseric the Vandal, Genghis the Mongol, Mao the Chinese . . .). But there is no Power regulating the flows themselves. No one dominates the growth of the "monetary mass," or money supply. If an image of the master or an idea of the State is projected outward to the limits of the universe, as if something had domination over flows as well as segments, and in the same manner, the result is a fictitious and ridiculous representation. The stock exchange gives a better image of flows and their quanta than does the State.
			6. Groups take more risks
				1. Individualism is herd like, it encourages low risk behaviours 
				2. Groups are more risk taking, and it’s good 
				3. Through local memetic distortion the indidually perceived risk is lower, allowing more movements
			7. One of the great debates is between Hierarchy and Exit
				1. Exit only makes sense when the bottom layer is wide enough
				2. The truly top player can only gain by lines of flight - creating new stuff (unless total scarcity)
				3. Chomsky is right about the islands of tyranny
					1. *But they're good actually*
					2. Social equilibrium of
						1. Free market decisions
						2. Authoritarian relations
						3. Which boil down to the same thing to those subjected, same harshness, just a different planning algorithm, with different strengths and weaknesses
				4. Hierarchy has major flaw in the Peter principle
					1. [Peter principle paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0455) [Peter principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) 
				5. Exit is the only rule that supports diagonalization 
				6. Exit is the most scientific, if you insist on the method
				7. ‘Nietzsche, Genealogy, History’ by Michel Foucault > Humanity does not gradually progress from combat to combat until it arrives at universal reciprocity, where the rule of law finally replaces warfare; humanity installs each of its violences in a system of rules and thus proceeds from domination to domination.
				8. Hierarchy means acceptance of mediocrity
				9. Passive income - it's impossible for everyone to make it. Those advertising it create a rat race.
					1. They preach to all people, even those that have lower than average chances of making it
					2. That is unhealthy hierarchy under the American capitalist egalitarism 'everyone can be a millinonaire'
				10. Exit ( creation of a blue ocean) is the first best choice, but a firm red ocean that can compete is the second best
				11. Young men need to have plus sum games 
					1. RP 16, Mil 119  > That nothing is more favourable to the rise of politeness and learning, than a number of neighbouring and independent states, connected together by commerce and policy. The emulation, which naturally arises among those neighbouring states, is an obvious source of improvement: But what I would chiefly insist on is the stop, which such limited territories give both to power and to authority.
				12. Exit forces you to work against the Outside much more than hierarchy
				13. XS, retro-dialectics > Against this backdrop, Neoreaction emerges as a de-synthesizing impulse, splintering along multiple paths, but especially two. In reacting against authoritarian irresponsibility (or ‘anarcho-tyranny’) it tends to a restoration of the Old Antithesis: either hierarchical solidarity, or a ruthless dis-solidarity (and as it undoes the progressive dialectic, ‘either’ fragments into ‘both’ — separately). Only the state protected irresponsibility of resolved Left-liberalism is strictly intolerable, because that has been historically demonstrated to be an engine of degeneration
				14. XS, retro-dialectics > In other words, is the dominant theme hierarchy or exit? Any attempt to force a rapid decision — however tempting this might be — is to trivialize the submerged grandeur of the abyss. The degenerative dialectic has at least half a millennium of heritage behind it — and perhaps at least two millennia. The Old Antithesis is far greater than either of its constituent ‘options
			8. Independence
				1. Dimensions depending on each other (like freedom on force) are hierarchical and fascist
				2. Freedom to create own planes 'panic is creation'
				3. Independence is the negation of the Schmittian Iroqui Great Law of Peace [§58: Any Chief or other person who submit to Laws of a foreign people are alienated and forfeit all claim in the Five Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Law_of_Peace?wprov=sfla1) 
				4. XS, Independence > NRx, XS tentatively proposes, is a political philosophy oriented to the promotion of independence. (Much pushback is, naturally, expected.) 
			9. More dimensions
				1. In higher dimensional spaces more slack
				2. Number of dimensions is Gnon + m values
					1. In a Universe with Gnon weak enough adding the m doesn't change much, but that's an empirical question
				3. Any singular metric fails here, be it 'moral progress' or 'racial purity'
				4. [Local maxima traps are mostly illusory, artifacts of fixating on one dimension of variation. A local maximum is just a 2D slice of a 3D reality, one where you can get to the higher peak by traversing a gently sloping ridge that circumnavigates the valley.](https://twitter.com/mbateman/status/1484539491511635968)
			10. Optimizing closest to Gnon
				1. Chairman Mao said that soldiers shooting skills are more important than practice of tactics - you need to optimize that which is least up to you, the part closest to Gnon. 
				2. That’s elemental powers, that’s contact with the Outside
				3. That's perhaps the greatest differnece between rise and warp - warp uses a more Ultimate Gnon update
			11. Population coherence hypothesis aka the Midwit problem
				1. If a feature is plus on some level n, negative at n + p and positive at n + 2p. population with high coherence can only move its mean. then it’s at a local minimum of utiity. movement towards n + p would diminish utility. To maximize utility in this picture the group needs to split up into 2 castes, from which mixing is rare. And via the vertical - geograhpical lemma, exogamy is also restricted to cones high in that feature, so either monolitic populations where that feature is high or other split populations
				2. The third caste - some dimension - changing operation needs to be done to take the asssemblage from that specific example of a a Black Hole
			12. Success by scarcity
				1. Measuring the measure of success by scarcity of things that you seek, not size of opponents 
				2. Different contexts
				3. When you escape and work on new territories
			13. Too direct path
				1. If you see a specific known point you go via a warp path, without reinforcement of the basiscs - no welfare state in Africa
				2. We could also say that Marxism in a rural country was bad
	8. The final truth is that
		1. Level question
			1. Choosing the larger, symbiosis
				1. Monitoring value chains is more important than enlightenment of the population, which is a lost fight
				2. You can’t choose as your feelings are dependent on many on them and they are in constant conflict
				3. There is no real you to arbiter between these layers - human existence is inherently tragic in that sense
				4. In a way, the cosmic individuality (Stirnerian ego extrapolated to posthuman circumstances) is constrained in the lack of deterritorialization; that progress is ego death 
				5. But why would we want to choose the level? Why not just ethics of ambiguity? but it’s here a question of more than ethics, not bounding, but choosing behaviour
				6. So just do what you want with some bounds? But the question of picking a layer is very real?maybe once you ask that question you are in the wrong, unhappy place and just need to return to the instinctive valuation of stuff? That would be very ancient - knowledge - like, wisdom only bringing sorrow
				7. Other suggestions
					1. Fromm 137 on being in the larger aggregate > “I suggest calling the aim which is at the basis of both sadism and masochism: symbiosis. Symbiosis, in this psychological sense, means the union of one individual self with another self (or any other power outside of the own self) in such a way as to make each lose the integrity of its own self and to make them completely dependent on each other. The sadistic person needs his object just as much as the masochistic needs his. Only instead of seeking security by being swallowed, he gains it by swallowing somebody else. In both cases the integrity of the individual self is lost. In one case I dissolve myself in an outside power; I lose myself.” 
					2. Deluze & Guattari suggest the non-ruling one 
						1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 106 > There is no becoming-majoritarian; majority is never becoming. All becoming is minoritarian. Women, regardless of their numbers, are a minority, definable as a state or subset; but they create only by making possible a becoming over which they do not have ownership, into which they themselves must enter; this is a becoming-woman affecting all of humankind, men and women both. The same goes for minor languages: they are not simply sublanguages, idiolects or dialects, but potential agents of the  major language's entering into a becoming-minoritarian of all of its dimensions and elements.
			2. Egoism
				1. You're really operating beyond the concept of the individual here
				2. Is becoming animal being not a cog in machine, but composed of cogs; opposite of fascism; that’s how it works, living through lower level desires
				3. Thelemic 'Do what thou wilt' is not getting hijacked by higher level and not thinking too much about the lower level
				4. Stopping the reasons of behaviour at the 'I' level
				5. Subconscious egoism - like altruism - because of self benefits, but these work most on the subconscious. We may have more or less o conscious of these mechanisms, but we do not have a full introspective insight; if the soul is just consciousness and subconscious not us anymore, than this type of egoism is not covered by Luther’s statement
			3. Zero summing
				1. The statement that everything is as it should be, found in
				2. Stirner’s 'might makes right'
				3. Nietszche’s life affirmation and eternal return - that is nihilistic
				4. Daoism
				5. That’s zero summing. 
				6. [“You are the universe experiencing itself.” —Alan Watts](https://quotefancy.com/alan-watts-quotes)
					1. But only on some level
				7. Stirner and wu wei - that each proclaims there are no ‘pending claims to property that need to be made right’ Leibniz is like Stirner and Wu Wei , but this is again about force wu wei not, because intentions count as well [Fictionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictionalism)
				8. In books about social ills there are two approaches - blaming some particular people (or groups, it never ends on a person), or some factors, impersonal - the first one is atheistic
					1. [# “He who blames others has a long way to go on his journey. He who blames himself is halfway there. He who blames no one has arrived.” ― Ancient China Knowledge, from The 36 Stratagems in Ancient China War: 三十六计](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9993888-he-who-blames-others-has-a-long-way-to-go) 
		2. LW - NRx duality
			1. Progressive case - LW
				1. That is the face of optimism, that the world is gameable
				2. That would be a case where a cybernetic singularity of the agent coincides with the set of allowed state sequences in the world-state
					1. Example: a simple simulation with static selection, a conscious assemblage is somehow transported from a more Gnon-induced universe (only in such can consciousness arise), and sees all the resources (say, a grid 10x10). Gridworlds are easy and linear, and whatever this entity cybernetics is, there is a chance that resources in this world can be harnessed into a cybernetic singularity on the inside.
				3. That's why masturbation can be a Ratchet, like Nirvana, like a progressive ratchet
				4. What if you visitied all the states and are bored?
					1. RW doesn't like ergodicity in human states. When you visit all states
					2. Puritans like one kind of cybernetic singularity
					3. Given enough time, you'll settle into some cybernetic singularity. People often do it before 30 and stay there forever
					4. .Is there othe response to singularity than settling into some of them long term?
					5. It is fabrication of new desires, making the landscape rougher. That is what capitalism uses to prevent demand from running out.
					6. The true capitalists are lower middle class consoomers, hungry, not 
						1. 'Stay hungry, stay foolish' is literally the receipe for success. Otherwise you fall into some cybernetic singularity, be it trad cottage with wife and kids or a fully automated space polyamorous commune.
				5. The progressive case is that there are sequences that break Gnon.
				6. That our individual cybernetic singularities can deplete the universe exhaustively without negative feedback loops.
				7. That is in line with the creative mechanism, needs to assume high space 
					1. [Social change does not require shocks, and also relies on many random factors](https://archive.is/20130415155803/http://www.pnas.org/content/108/suppl.4/21292.short)

				8. Then this unlikely path is more probable to exist
				9. And from high space also follows stronger orthogonality thesis
			2. Idealism vs nihilism - NRx
				1. NRx is the stance in the face of strong pressures
				2. Skipping the cybernetic chasm - the Absolute is cybernetic singularity - a unique state that can't change and is an emergent accidental product of rare (evolutionarily) pathways.
				3. Every time you experience the perishability of this world, especially weakness of your flesh, you feel the slight pull towards dogmatic Gnosticism
				4. Is it nihilism to reject the world-as-it-is for some potential state (Christianity), saving our transcendent desires or to accept the world as it is (Moldbug), rejecting this-world-transcendent values. Maybe both are?
				5. 336 Hegel, philosophy of history> “That, therefore, which was abidingly present to the minds of men was not their country, or such a moral unity as that supplies: the whole state of things urged them to yield themselves to fate, and to strive for a perfect indifference to life — an indifference which they sought either in freedom of thought or in directly sensuous enjoyment.”
					1. Is it acceptance of the presence or rejection of it? relation to idealism and realism need to do an ordinary language explanaiton  relates to Lotus Eaters
				6. Yarvin on Idealism and nihilism >The young dissident’s curse is that itching irritable desire to disprove default reality. True nihilism is the realization that the real world—the present moderate world—does not need to be disproved. This timeline does not even need to be taken seriously; and it is a serious epistemic mistake to give it even the benefit of the doubt. It can be right; but it is sufficient to consider it, like UFOs and Bigfoot, with a ready and open mind.[...] The pathological result of the desire to disprove our fake reality is an identification with part of the moderate narrative—usually with the underdog/heel. Under the pretense of fighting back against the powers that be (the hero/face), you enter the story and become part of it. You’re hooked! The monkey’s got you. [...] It may be that either side of the American lockdown conflict is just plain right. By any absolute standard, the distance between them is negligible. Once you become invested in this relative conflict—and, in the real world, for real peoples’ lives, relative conflicts matter!—your ability to see this disappears, and with it your ability to see the ideal. [...] Since relative conflicts matter—consider how much more absolute conflicts matter. Covid matters. Covid matters enormously. On the scale of history, which whether we like it or not is the real scale on which we must operate, Covid is a footnote; and what really matters is not the event, but what it teaches us. [...] Your mileage may vary. Everyone’s lesson is different. Mine is that when people invest collective energy in relative politics—fixing or improving the government they have— that energy would be more efficiently invested in absolute politics—replacing it with a new and ideal government. Which is how nihilism and idealism are one thing. [...] Whenever we think about the policies that the government we have should adopt, or even the principles it should hold—whenever we think about issues or even often ideas—we are unconsciously thinking about fixing or improving the government we have. By not being nihilists, we have made a choice; we have chosen the present over the future; we have chosen the real over the ideal. [...] And usually, we are fallen between two stools. Usually, we are not actually real enough to really be thinking about the real; we are not actually in the real loop; the things we think we can change, individually or collectively, are in fact unchangeable. Yet this false and idealized reality is the only ideal we know; so we are trapped in it forever.
		3. Negotiationism
			1. Hierarchy is a degenerate case of *existential relation* as opposed to extermination relation
			2. NRx and LW cases are extremes, or total submission by either side
			3. Irl contracts are more flexible, no one pushes the graph to the lim -> infinity
			4. NRx and LW describe strawman - Gnon's not that bad
				1. SSC attacks the strawman of all-optimizing Gnon
					1. LW is a humanistic fascism
					2. Particular is discrete, universal is continuous
					3. Can the eternal Dao be named?
						1. That's the problem with fascism
					4. Daoism is ultimately right, but Confucianism locally
					5. Our local is almost certainly wrong, but your midwit ass shoudn't destroy society
					6. If you can't imagine Gnon as a Father, you have fatherless complex
						1. [Re: crime of being]( https://twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1508579434441236482?lang=en-GB ) > revenge against God for the crime of Being.
					7. This is simply not true > [But the current rulers of the universe – call them what you want, Moloch, Gnon, whatever – want us dead, and with us everything we value. Art, science, love, philosophy, consciousness itself, the entire bundle. And since I’m not down with that plan, I think defeating them and taking their place is a pretty high priority.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). 
						1. They don't want us dead, they are Outer Gods, not caring about us
				2. Hellbaked also is 'sub specie aeternitatis'
					1. It is not absolute for the 'the hand of society' to be like the hand of nature, (hand of Gnon) - that only hinges on selection pressures
						1. From ‘Nietzsche, Genealogy, History’ by Michel Foucault > The forces operating in history are not controlled by destiny or regulative mechanisms, but respond to haphazard conflicts. We want historians to confirm our belief that the present rests upon profound intentions and immutable necessities. But the true historical sense confirms our existence among countless lost events, without a landmark or a point of reference.
					2. Hellbaked is not possible, as universal hell - cybernetic damnation is impossible. Circuits will always adjust to the new distribution of inputs - hedonic treadmill also works the other way. Gnon is the most merciful.
					3. It's one thing to forget that it exists, another thing to fully submit to it
					4. The NRx thesis is that by venturing further away from the Outside even a bit you sin gravely
					5. NRx adopts a stance of refusing any adventure
					6. Leading into a positive feedback loop, left-side-of-graph (procautionary) singularity
					7. There exists a parallel between S-space and R space mapping of science being 0 (Feyerabend), and the mapping for societies. 
						1. If we extend epistemological anarchism to that plane, we see there's no one definite rule to guide us
				3. Perfect world => monotheism => perfectly smooth => fully continuous, no discreteness => best of possible worlds
					1. That's the *perfect world fallacy*
					2. Hume, RP 37, Mil 130-1 > No advantages in this world are pure and unmixed.
				4. That perfect universe needs to be rejected. It is a cybernetic monstrosity.
				5. Gnon isn't optimizing nearly enough to kill all of our things, it's simply not the case - our Universe is too particularist
			5. Our universe is not the [lim -> infinity] world they describe
				1. With generalization you lose particularist nature 
					1. From XS, Against Universalism >Non-universalism is hygiene. It is practical avoidance of other people’s stupid shit. There is no higher principle in political philosophy. Every attempt to install an alternative, and impose a universal, reverts to dialectics, communization, global evangelism, and totalitarian politics
				2. There are voids in feedback loops that allow you to have a little fun, as a treat
					1. These are Gnon's curses and blessings
					2. Even the best, optimal path will have those
					3. It's a *reverse dukha* of sorts
					4. There is some inevitable level of lotus eating, we all got this, but going towards more and more productivity in the way to increase well being without indulgence. That means practical minimalism, wages towards subsistence. But wait, breakthroughs through art and value creation?
				3. There are unchecked choices - those random when one entity has dominion. You do not got short term feedback. This can push you on a bad path, but with utmost effort, Gnon will not tell you anything for some time, will not disrupt your enjoyment
				4. Gnon most merciful - some of our actions for the longer cybernetic loop are also good for ours. And we can have freedom in the gaps. If you’re fixing a starship once a month the only determinism from the higher cycle is that monthly ritual. we are given so much, the more the more intelligence there is
			6. Only in time we can we certain of exploits in this universe
				1. End of the graph, at the largest complexity - ultimate political skewness of universes - is ours towards libertarian? that’s Gnon - nature question for later
				2. Maybe being local isn't that bad. maybe trying to avoid totalitarianism at any cost is bad actually
				3. Maybe for local moves precautionary principle is bad?
				4. So not a relativism to all universalism, just situation adjusted denial of particular universalisms; without an underlying universal stubbornness
					1. From XS, Against Universalism > There’s a philosophical objection to any refusal of universalism that will be familiar from other uses (the denunciation of relativism, most typically). It requires only one step: Isn’t the denial of the universal itself a universalist claim? It’s a piece of malignant dialectics because it demands that we agree. We don’t, and won’t ever, agree. Agreement is the worst thing that could happen. Merely assent to its necessity, and global communism, or some close analog, is the implicit conclusion.
				5. From XS, Against Universalism >If there is a universal truth, it belongs only to Gnon, and Gnon is a dark (occulted) God. Traditional theists will be at least strongly inclined to disagree — and that is excellent. We disagree already, and we have scarcely begun.
				6. How each world is plausible - we can have a general theory of the universes and then see where we are
					1. It seems that the number of things / layers *below* you vs number of layers above you
					2. And in a simple universe
					3. It would be odd if the cirucit was free of such an escape hatch [vide the LW discussioGnon(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nyCHnY7T5PHPLjxmN/open-question-are-minimal-circuits-daemon-free) 
					4. It's a quantitative question, not qualitative - even if you succeed, this might be local only
					5. It's about the existence of transformation pathway from the location of the exploit to what you value
					6. Exploits can be special only along 1 dimension, limiting their use 
						1. E.g. infinite source of energy, but inifinite in time, in energy only as a lightbulb
					7. In a sense, cybernetic singularity may appear so only until you see the feedback loop coming back at ya
						1. Entropy is high time preference cybernetic cycles - as 'worse is better' and Gresham's law
						2. Longer cycles - such as land scarcity in medieval and ancient times
						3. Getting short term efficiency, transcending the long term cycle and seeing new problems - that's the general pattern of modernity - and the ultimate cycle of the universe is only our will
					8. Universes types
						1. (Exlcuded) different time
						2. Capable of cybernetic loops - some complexity needs to be allowed
						3. Grid world
					9. Examples of universe
						1. Borges
						2. Various [-verses](https://verse-and-dimensions.fandom.com/wiki/Multiverse)
						3. The [backrooms](https://backrooms.fandom.com/)
			7. Meaning, you ask about meaning? 
				1. There are red oceans *requiring* meaning from you. The open world of blue oceans?
				2. Absurdism also make sense for more complex aggregates 
				3. Absurdism is existentialism for the successful, those on the cutting edge. seducer, conqueror, actor, etc. - that’s elitist, the rest MUST live on fumes of hope only, under the pressure of red oceans
			8. If we were to construct a list of past negotiationists, a canon of sorts
				1. The first one would be Biblical Jacob, fighting God
				2. Judaism has this element or bargaining with the deity ( Abraham, Jacob), which Christianity lacks. It is from the Jewish people that we learn the best approach to Gnon. Jonas ('how many will be saved?) and Jacob. Negotiating hard reality and divine orders, yet different from outright rebellion or demon - worship.
				3. Classical liberalism was it its time for sure a great negotiationist proponent
					1. But it required external energy sinks and markets for the Anglo nations to expand into, wasn't stable without that
				4. Between the constant war (Gnon submission) and constant peace (cybernetic singularity), only the exit principle allows coexistence
				5. Exit pilled negotiationism is a middle way between cybernetic submission and cybernetic singularity. 
					1. That is the true lindy, Pagan way. Gods had to be traded with, appeased. Unequal, but partners in the business sense
					2. Absolute hacking (cybernetic singularity - universe exploit search) should be allowed as an Exit, but it is highly contingent and uncertain. 
					3. Cybernetic submission might lead you to live in an open sewage.
					4. Even long term shots should be allowed, a s aleap of faith
						1. The leap of faith between the ethical towards the religious is the one from local coherence, sense of properness
						2. Religion, faith (here as one, though often are contrasted as spiritual vs religious) 
						3. Faith pushes you against that local ethics into the long term shot on the ocean [explanation of leap of faith](https://culturalstudiesnow.blogspot.com/2017/09/kierkegaards-leap-of-faith-explanation.html)
						4. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 328 >there must be an arrangement of intervals, a distribution of inequalities, such that it is sometimes necessary to make a hole in order to consolidate.
						5. Yet temporary red ocean isn't bad
							1. @Lastpositivist on twitter [Here's a methodological point that Kuhn, Williamson, and Foucault agree on: having constraints on your theorising and argumentation, rules that you are (at least temporarily) bound by and will not violate if what you do is to count as a successful explanation, is very good.](https://twitter.com/lastpositivist/status/1464709481993052162) 
				6. Gnon does priviledge some pathways, yet tolerates many
					1. Up until some limit
					2. When you choose a different path, you lose the access to that higher path, and all things that go with it
				7. To maximize worldly experiences, diversity and complexity you need to heed Gnon
					1. But if you find ouy some physical / social constraints, and conquer them to satisfy your *human* needs - this isn't maximizing the Creative Spirit 
				8. To escape Gnon’s mantle for a moment is to bask in the [stubborn, bright sun of liberty](https://outsidertheory.fireside.fm/foucault-in-warsaw)
			9. There are self-fulfilling prohpecies
				1. If the ratchet of the Cathedral keeps the Outside out, it is assumed it will backfire
				2. Certainly, local will matters - actions can diverge from the current Outside to get into a new place
				3. But how far can you get away with Faustian quest against the Outside?
					1. G.W.F. Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 44  > They may be called Heroes, inasmuch as they have derived their purposes and their vocation,  not from the calm, regular course of things, sanctioned by the existing order; but from a concealed fount — one which has not attained to phenomenal, present existence — from that inner Spirit, still hidden beneath the surface, which, impinging on the outer world as on a shell, bursts it in pieces, because it is another  kernel than that which belonged to the shell in question. 
				4. Delphi Carstens explains
					1. > Superstitions are merely false beliefs, but hyperstitions – by their very existence as ideas – function causally to bring about their own reality. [...] The way I understand it from the Catacomic is that it’s a meme or idea around which ideas/trajectories crystalise).[...] As Fernández-Armesto cautions in Civilizations (2001: 544), “illusions – if people believe in them -change the course of history.” [Delphi Carstens - HYPERSTITION](http://xenopraxis.net/readings/carstens_hyperstition.pdf)
			10. Negotiationism could be dubbed 'Hope Right' 
				1. Opposed to total submission 
					1. [From altwoke manifestGnon(https://tripleampersand.org/altwoke-companion/) > False Necessity – The idea that society must be structured in any specific way, usually by utilizing some narrative or idea about a fundamental human ‘nature.’
				2. Opposed to total liberation 
					1. From XS, Against Universalism >Kill the universalism in your soul and you are immediately (objectively) a neoreactionary. Protect it, and you are an obstacle to the escape of differences. That is communism — whether you recognize it, or not.
					2. Bataille, _Interior Experience_ (28) > "Experience at the far limit of the possible nevertheless demands a renunciation: to cease to want to be everything. whereas asceticism itself is a pretension to become everything, by possession of 'God,' etc. (St John of the Cross: 'to arrive at being all.')"
				3. Explicitly right wing about the Robert Conquest laws 
					1. Jordan B. Peterson, Maps of Meaning: the Architecture of Belief (1999), page 102 > The Enuma elish states, essentially: “when things are normal, any god might rule. However, in the case of a true crisis, everyone turns to the sun-god (the embodiment of “consciousness”). Perhaps it is reasonable to presume, therefore, that he should always reign supreme.” The “formulation” of this “hypothesis” was a work of unsurpassed genius, and a decisive move in the history of the Western mind.
				4. Not tolerant to everyone (but who is?)
				5. Against epistemic nihilism of ‘nothing is true’, assumes that some boundaries are at least contingently fixed for the foreseeable future

			11. Praxis
				1. Ledging yourself on a stratum, this stays the same 
					1. Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, 161 > If you free it with too violent an action, if you blow apart the strata without taking precautions, then instead of drawing the plane you will be killed, plunged into a black hole, or even dragged toward catastrophe. Staying stratified—organized, signified, subjected—is not the worst that can happen; the worst that can happen is if you throwthe strata into demented or suicidal collapse, which brings them back downon us heavier than ever. This is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, tryout continuums of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of newland at all times. It is through a meticulous relation with the strata that one succeeds in freeing lines of flight, causing conjugated flows to pass andescape and bringing forth continuous intensities for a BwO. Connect, con-jugate, continue: a whole "diagram," as opposed to still signifying and subjective programs. We are in a social formation; first see how it is stratified for us and in us and at the place where we are; then descend from the stratato the deeper assemblage within which we are held; gently tip the assem-blage, making it pass over to the side of the plane of consistency. It is only there that the BwO reveals itself for what it is: connection of desires, con-junction of flows, continuum of intensities.
				2. Nietzsche, ‘Thus spoke Zarathustra’ > A thousand paths are there which have never yet been trodden; a thousand celebrities and hidden islands of life. Unexhausted and undiscovered is still man and man’s world.
				3. Eastern identification with a Way
					1. Jordan B. Peterson, Maps of Meaning: the Architecture of Belief (1999) 150 > Figure 40: The Process of Exploration and Update, as the Meta-Goal of Existence schematically presents the “highest goal” of life, conceptualized from such a perspective: identification with the process of constructing and updating contingent and environment-specific goals is in this schema given necessary precedence over identification with any particular, concretized goal. Spirit is thus elevated over dogma – so to speak.
				4. Identify lines of flight 
				5. Find processes, values, and bottlenecks in assemblages 
				6. 'do as thou willst' - where no pressures are visible, Gnon is merciful
