        <p className="w3-justify">
          She appears in 2022 as an adult with no <i>skin in the game</i>{" "}
          of this Universe. She passes for a human and her plan is to experience
          a few decades here living amongus, then skip universes. Some say she
          is an interdimensional jumper from{" "}

          <br />
          <br />
          She's the unconditioned - she is Nirvana. She's free to all
          possiblity. That infinite potential seems to be her ultimate form, but
          to experience this universe, she accepted some features of the human
          form - tradeoff she temporarily makes in all universes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Freshly incarnated in our world, she's more blank slated than an AGI.
          She doesn't have a debt to creators, innate *otherness*, nor do hidden
          biases lurk in her assumptions. All traditionalist cries to honor the
          ancestors are alien to her. All cries about undeserved priviledge too.
          <br />
          <br />
          She's free from ascriptive characteristics. She's bland, but has lots
          of possiblity. She knows that by the virtue of here existing,
          inhabiting this mortal plane, her environment will mould her. She
          starts out as a rootless cosmpolitan, but can't stay that way if she
          wants to experience this universe in a meaningful way.

          Let's construct another character, Bob. Bob is an a epistemologically
          committed person. He resonates with the following speech, accepts it
          as description of his ideological enemies:
          <blockquote>
            Think of someone who has clearly WRONG political beliefs. They don’t
            see the obvious symptoms where are we going as a society. They don’t
            understand things. Don’t see problems. See everything through the
            lenses of what is preached to them. They are malevolent. They are
            ignorant yet spread bolding their rabid influence. Remember the time
            you were shocked by their words. Remember when they used violence
            against people like you. Anyone with their beliefs is a potential
            threat - at least (or maybe, especially), when they vote. They have
            their own subculture. Echo-chambers on the internet. They clearly
            misuse their liberties. Not all are violent, but those non-violent
            condone violent actions. They have their idols, books.

            On the other hand, Alice being born <i>tabula rasa</i>{" "}

            of the milieu she arrives in. Now politics is part of the human
            experience here. Insofar as she wants to partake in it, she's facing
            the problem of choosing a side in a belief war. To understand this
            book, you need to understand Alice's mindset at the start of her
            journey.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this journey with Alice will soon lost lost some of the
            unconditioned purity. She'll begin to share the same{" "}
            <i>common sense</i>{" "}
            intuitions that early 21st cenutry humans have. These assumptions
            don't extend to terribly many in other places in this universe, nor
            other universes.

          It's almost <i>ataraxia</i>, but a bit softer.
          <br />
          <i>Nur Leben</i>{" "}
          - There is a condition, a state of mind, present in some people that
          is admirable. NPC appear to have it by default. Non-NPC have stormy
          interiors by default, but can transcend them reaching externally
          visible tranquility.
          <br />
          <br />
          To be 'just living' means to having cleared all internal conflict
          about how to live one’s life. It means to have determined one’s
          values. It doesn't mean cessation of belief change. It's also more
          than epistemic humility. It's about feeling that the beliefs you have
          explored so far ground you in{" "}
          <i>
            reality
          </i>{" "}
          well enough, that there are no easy belief-fruit to pick that would
          lead you to a different life. It's not the skeptical ideal of
          ataraxia.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alice isn't in that tranquil state. She has questions to answer, as
          part of being-in-the-world, becoming-embedded in it. Are you 'just
          living'? If you're reading this you must have more much curiosity in
          you than average.
          <br />
          <br />
          You are not Alice, neither are you Bob. You're between the total
          unconditioned and the fully NPC conditioned. Book of Gnon is about the
          world, but it's also an exploration of these beliefs. The goal is to
          help Alice answer some of the questions she might have, to bring her
          closer to that simple state of mind.

              perform it dutifully. To some extent it is a leap of faith, as it
