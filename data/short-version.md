1. There is no escape from your belief being a web of cyclic graph of beliefs [?]
	1. If it is not my will that creates all, then there is something beside me. That is Nature.
	2. We are bound to have some set of beliefs, best if circular, at the core of our big set of beliefs.
	3. We can put our statements into networks of relations - webs like Indra's Net / Quine's Web
	4. These networks divide fractally into language games. The words for language games that are established and large in the number of adherents are: metanarrative, memeplex, brainworm, ideology, lifestance, egregore, religion. Webs of statements are physical entities, to varying degree embedded in social reality.
	5. Language games can be grouped in many ways, the one used here has 4 layers - SPQR. Its purpose is discursive to talk to individual beings analytically and normatively - by code, law or habit.
	6. Invidiuals in society are nodes for the metanetwork of all the metanarratives. Wittgensteinian *[Lebensform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_life_(philosophy))* similar to soul and Jungian archetype
	7. Spirit is the animating principle
2. Universe is particular
	1. Universe constantly mutates, tries something new. It's a computer program always underway. To see if it terminates it's impossible. (stopping problem). There is no [Heimarmene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimarmene).
	2. Universe is limited
	3. You can zoom out of the universe
	4. First cycles *Oceans* - There are patterns in the Universe
	5. Laws - writing equations about atomic particles and waves is tulpamancy. The basic Laws of the Universe - the fundamental Spirit(s) behind the best tulpamancy.
	6. The sum of basic and emergent laws is Gnon. (also known as Dharma, Logos, Rte)
	7. Mechanisms for competition, cooperation, specialization, standardization and overshoot and dieoff are the same everywhere. S curves all over the place.
	8. This results in formation of Spirits which always have a valence of experience in a certain range.
	9. The evolution of the Universe is Chi - particles setting on different Li configurations.
3. Oceans are something on which *navigare necesse est*. How to approach navigation?
	10. There must be some optimal routes
	11. Being an observer already changes the observed state
	12. The egoist - anarch axis (Stirner vs Junger) is diagonalized by the realization that an arbitrary choice of a real Spirit to serve is not possible
	13. In the same way we can discard the following views: Stirnerian 'all property is owned justly, even if it was stolen, because the thief deserves it by the force of keeping it', wu-wei as a Daoist all-precept, zero-summing, Leibniz 'best of possible worlds', and Jesus's 'who is without fault let him throw the first stone' Are stoicism acceptance and Nietzschena eternal return good too? maybe accepting world as it is, aesthetic pheomenon?
	14. Basic heuristics include
	15. There are boundary conditions
	16. There are heuristics at each stage
	8. The final truth is that
