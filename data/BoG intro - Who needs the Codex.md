> NRx is still a cultural infant, far younger than the Millennium, even under the most mythically-creative extension of its genesis, and the cognitive ferment it catalyzes remains extraordinary. It has still scarcely begun. The ties of a consistent name are the very least that are required to concentrate it. NRx, whatever it turns out to be, needs lashing together, because explosions tend to fly apart — and it is unmistakably an explosion

### Prologue - Alice

 Meet Alice from Andromeda*. She appears in 2022 as an adult with no skin in the game of this. She passes for a human and her plan is to experience a few decades here as living amongus, then skip universes. Some say she is an interdimensional jumper from Kardashev type 5 civilization, some say that an Inspector from simulation level above.

 She's the unconditioned - she is Nirvana. She's free to all possiblity. That seems to be her ultimate form, but to experience this universe, she accepted some features of the human form - tradeoff she temporarily makes in all universes.
 
 Freshly incarnated in our world, she's more blank slated than an AGI. She doesn't have a debt to creators, innate *otherness*, nor do hidden biases lurk in her assumptions. All traditionalist cries to honor ancestors are alient to her. All cries about undeserved priviledge too. She's free from ascriptive characteristics. She's bland, but has lots of possiblity. She knows that by existing, her environment will mould her. She starts out as a rootless cosmpolitan, but can't stay that way if she wants to experience this universe in a meaningful way.

We need to make a couple of assumptions to make this exercise work. Talking about beliefs is a meaningful activity
We need to suspend the question [if ‘beliefs’ exist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/#ElimInst). 
We take ‘belief’ as a thing that people list when asked about their beliefs. These include religious, scientific, political, mathematical statements. Both descriptive and normative (if we may say so!, use this distinction). 

There is no need for a [Descartes - deep examination](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-epistemology/) of beliefs about nature of reality. For now. Let’s just think politics.  
That is the perspective of you and me, at the moment of writing, *homo sapiens* living in the beginning of the 21st century. But more entities share the concerns here.
In this journey with Alice isn't fully unconditioned. There are *common sense* intuitions that early 21st cenutry humans do, even if they don't extend to terribly many condiitions.

## Who Alice isn't
Let's construct another character, Bob. Bob is an a epistemologically committed person. He resonates with the following speech, accepts it as description of his ideological enemies: 
> Think of someone who has clearly WRONG political beliefs. They don’t see the obvious symptoms where are we going as a society. They don’t understand things. Don’t see problems. See everything through the lenses of what is preached to them. They are malevolent. They are ignorant yet spread bolding their rabid influence. Remember the time you were shocked by their words. Remember when they used violence against people like you. Anyone with their beliefs is a potential threat - at least (or maybe, especially), when they vote. They have their own subculture. Echo-chambers on the internet. They clearly misuse their liberties. Not all are violent, but those non-violent condone violent actions. They have their idols, books. 
  
 On the other hand, Alice on being born as a *tabula rasa* is a political nihilist and a relativist [relativists](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/). Alice doesn't have [gods](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/God_is_dead) nor [anyone to guide her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan#Killing_the_Buddha). She shares the [disbelief in metanarratives](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/) of the milieu she arrives in. Now politics is part of the human experience here. Insofar as she wants to partake in it, she's facing the problem of choosing a side in a belief war.

To understand this book, you need to understand Alice's mindset at the start of her journey.

## transition to action

It's essentially _ataraxia_, but a bit softer
Nur Leben - There is a condition, a state of mind, I would say present in some people that is admirable.
characteristics of ‘just living’
having cleared all internal conflict about how to live one’s life; determined one’s values
it does not necessarily mean
but it is not intended to perpetually reassess its goals!!! wait, that’s eudaimonia, ataraxia
that is already touched upon a bit in the Llch manifesto, 
but there it’s more general, for the society and not gradual building of beliefs. might just develop here from like Descartes did
  
would all be like that? skeptical ideal of ataraxia? The receipt: accelerating the dialectical exchange, making it truly superset, through fast exchange based on Lully. Achieving ideal through rejecting it. and escaping the lotus eating trap

looking for something just acceptable enough for everyone

### 2 possible conclusions
Pick some metanarrative, some Lebensformen and become good at it. You will benefit them greatly if you perform it dutifully. To some extent it is a leap of faith, as it is only locally sanctioned by the Outside.

Throw away the ladder and focus on the object level. Rely on the Outside, seek the real beyond the layers of metanarratives, accept no metanarrative as final truth. 
See how deep the rabbit hole goes

Now are these conclusions different?
they differ by degree. Choice between them is itself a leap of faith. They are basically exploration vs exploitation.
